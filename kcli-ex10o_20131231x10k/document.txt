Eligibility

You are eligible to enroll in the Plan as of the first day of the month
coincident with or following your date of hire if you are classified by Kansas
City Life Insurance Company on its payroll records as a fulltime employee.

You are not eligible to participate in the Plan if you are classified by
Kansas City Life Insurance Company in any category other than a fulltime
employee, including

  
  
  
•



regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours per week,  
  
  
  
  
•



a seasonal or temporary employee,  
  
  
  
  
•



a leased employee,  
  
  
  
  
•



an independent contractor, or  
  
  
  
  
•



a member of a collective bargaining unit, unless the collective bargaining
agreement provides for your participation in the Plan.  
  
A person not classified by Kansas City Life Insurance Company as an employee
will not be eligible to participate in the Plan regardless of whether a court
or tax or regulatory authority determines that the person is an employee.

You are also eligible to enroll in the Plan if you satisfy retiree eligibility
requirements.

Your eligible Dependents may also participate in the Plan. An eligible
Dependent is considered to be:

  
  
  
•



your Spouse, as defined in Section 14,  Glossary  ;  
  
  
  
  
•



your or your Spouse's child who is under age 26, including a natural child,
stepchild, a legally adopted child, a child placed for adoption or a child for
whom you or your Spouse are the legal guardian; or  
  
  
  
  
•



An unmarried, disabled child provided the following requirements are
satisfied:  
  
  

* * *

•



child has been covered under a previous medical Plan and the child became
disabled prior to the limiting age of this Plan. Proof of prior coverage and
disability will be required.  
  
  
  
  
\



the child is unable to be selfsupporting due to a mental or physical handicap
or disability and, thus, depends mainly on you for support;  
  
  
  
  
\



the child became disabled prior to the limiting age above;  
  
  
  
  
\



the child is covered under this plan as of the limiting age, or the child is
enrolled during your initial enrollment period and is continuously covered
under another plan or policy through the effective date of coverage under this
plan;  
  
  
  
  
\



you provide to Kansas City Life Insurance Company proof of the child’s
incapacity and dependency within 31 days of the date coverage would otherwise
have ended because the child reaches the limiting age; and  
  
  
  
  
\



you provide proof, upon Kansas City Life Insurance Company’s request, that the
child continues to meet these requirements.  
  
The proof might include medical examinations at Kansas City Life Insurance
Company’s expense. However, you will not be asked for this information more
than once a year. If you do not supply such proof within 31 days, the Plan
will no longer pay Benefits for that child.

Coverage will continue, as long as the enrolled Dependent is incapacitated and
dependent upon you, unless coverage is otherwise terminated in accordance with
the terms of the Plan.

To be eligible for coverage under the Plan, a Dependent must reside within the
United States.

Note:  Your Dependents may not enroll in the Plan unless you are also
enrolled. If you and your Spouse are both covered under the Kansas City Life
Employee Medical Plan, you may each be enrolled as a Participant or be covered
as a Dependent of the other person, but not both. In addition, if you and your
Spouse are both covered under the Kansas City Life Employee Medical Plan, only
one parent may enroll your child as a Dependent.

A Dependent also includes a child for whom health care coverage is required
through a Qualified Medical Child Support Order or other court or
administrative order, as described in Section 13,  Other Important Information
.

You are required to provide proof of your dependents’ eligibility upon
request. False or misrepresented eligibility information will cause both your
coverage and your dependents’ coverage to be irrevocably terminated
(retroactively to the extent permitted by law), and could be grounds for
employee discipline up to and including termination. Failure to provide timely
notice of loss of eligibility will be considered intentional
misrepresentation.

RETIREE ELIGIBILITY

Retired employees  (as defined in Section 14) who satisfy eligibility
requirements outlined below may continue coverage by paying the applicable
premium for Medical Benefits.

  

* * *

4 SECTION 2  INTRODUCTION

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

(Premiums for retiree medical coverage may vary depending on your years of
service at retirement.) Employees hired on or after January 1, 2005 are not
eligible for retiree medical coverage under the Plan. While the employer
expects retiree coverage to continue, the employer reserves the right to
modify or discontinue retiree coverage at any time. Retired employees,
dependents and surviving spouses who are eligible for Medicare are not
eligible to continue coverage under this Plan for the Prescription Drug
Program.

Active Employees Who Become Eligible to Retire in the Future – Medical

Employees Hired On or After 1/1/2000 but prior to 1/1/2005  – If you were
hired on or after 1/1/2000 but prior to 1/1/2005 and you retire with a minimum
of one hundred twenty (120) months of service and you continuously
participated in the medical Plan during the last sixty (60) months of
employment immediately prior to retirement you are eligible for retiree
medical Plan coverage.

Employees Hired Prior to 1/1/2000  \ If you were hired prior to 1/1/2000 and
you continuously participated in the medical Plan during the last sixty (60)
months of employment immediately prior to retirement, you are eligible for
retiree medical Plan coverage.

If you are eligible for retiree medical coverage, you may also enroll your
Spouse and your dependent children in retiree coverage as long as they were
enrolled in the Plan on your date of retirement. If you drop coverage for
yourself, your spouse or your dependents at any time, you will not be eligible
to reenroll those individuals in retiree coverage at any future date. If you
obtain a new spouse or dependent by marriage, birth or adoption, however, you
may add the new spouse or dependent to coverage as long as you notify Human
Resources within 31 days of the marriage, birth or adoption.

If, while you are on retiree medical coverage, you are rehired by Kansas City
Life Insurance Company in a position classified as fulltime employee, your
retiree medical coverage will cease and you will become eligible for coverage
as an active employee. When you later terminate your employment, you will
retain your eligibility for retiree medical coverage (but your additional
service after your initial retirement will not be taken into account to
determine your premiums). If you are rehired as a parttime employee, your
retiree medical coverage will continue.

Retiree coverage for you and your spouse and dependents may continue until it
would otherwise end under the terms of the Plan (e.g., you cease making
premium payments, divorce, child ceasing to be an eligible dependent, fraud).

NOTE:  If you are an active employee and you have satisfied all requirements
to be eligible for retiree medical coverage when you retire, you will lose
such eligibility if your schedule drops to parttime status at any time prior
to your retirement (even if you return to fulltime status before your
retirement).

SURVIVING SPOUSE ELIGIBLITY

  

* * *

5 SECTION 2  INTRODUCTION

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

Surviving spouses of Retired Employees who die while both are covered under
the Plan may continue retiree medical coverage. Coverage of the Retired
Employee’s eligible dependents may also continue after the Retired Employee’s
death until it would otherwise end under the terms of the Plan (e.g., ceasing
to be an eligible dependent) or until the surviving spouse is no longer
covered under the plan. (Note that eligible dependents may not continue
coverage if there is no surviving spouse who also continues coverage.)

Surviving spouses of active employees who die while working for Kansas City
Life Insurance Company may elect retiree medical coverage under the Plan if
they were covered under the Plan at the time of the employee’s death and the
employee would have been eligible for retiree medical coverage under the rules
stated above if the employee had retired on the date preceding his or her
death. If the surviving spouse continues coverage, coverage of any dependent
children of the deceased employee may also be continued (until it would
otherwise end under the Plan). Other spouses and dependent children who lose
coverage on account of the employee’s death will be entitled to COBRA coverage
(as explained in Section 12).

When Both Spouses Are Covered by This Plan as the Result of Current or Past
Employment with the Employer

If, within a family, both spouses have or have had an employee/employer
relationship with the employer, and are covered under this Plan as an
employee, dependent or, retiree, and meet the eligibility criteria for retiree
medical coverage, such spouse may elect to change his or her coverage options
or those of his or her dependents who are currently covered under the Plan in
the event that coverage for the other spouse terminates or one of the spouses
experiences a status change, i.e., active to retiree. In this instance, the
change of coverage options must be made within thirty (31) days of the status
change or termination of one spouse’s coverage.

Cost of Coverage

You and Kansas City Life Insurance Company share in the cost of the Plan. Your
contribution amount depends on the Plan you select and the family members you
choose to enroll.

Employee (nonretiree) contributions are deducted from your paychecks on a
beforetax basis. Beforetax dollars come out of your pay before federal
income and Social Security taxes are withheld  and in most states, before
state and local taxes are withheld. This gives your contributions a special
tax advantage and lowers the actual cost to you.

Your contributions are subject to review and Kansas City Life Insurance
Company reserves the right to change your contribution amount from time to
time.

Contribution rates will be communicated to you each year at open enrollment.

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

How to Enroll

To enroll, notify Human Resources within 31 days of the date you first become
eligible for medical Plan coverage. If you do not enroll within 31 days, you
will need to wait until the next annual Open Enrollment to make your benefit
elections unless you have a change in status.

Each year during annual Open Enrollment, you have the opportunity to review
and change your medical election. Any changes you make during Open Enrollment
will become effective the following January 1.

* * *

Important

If you wish to change your benefit election following your marriage, birth of
a child, adoption of a child, placement for adoption of a child or other
family status change, you must contact Human Resources within 31 days of the
event. Otherwise, you will need to wait until the next annual Open Enrollment
to change your elections.

* * *

When Coverage Begins

If Human Resources receives your properly completed enrollment during your
initial enrollment period, coverage will begin on the first day of the month
coincident with or following your date of hire. If you do not enroll during
your initial enrollment period, but enroll during an open enrollment period,
your coverage will begin on the following January 1. Coverage for your
Dependents will start on the date your coverage begins, provided you have
enrolled them in a timely manner.

Coverage for a Spouse or Dependent stepchild that you acquire via marriage
becomes effective the first of the month following the date Human Resources
receives the enrollment form you completed to add your newly acquired
dependents provided you notify Human Resources within 31 days of the date of
your marriage. Coverage for Dependent children acquired through birth,
adoption, or placement for adoption is effective the date of the family status
change, provided you notify Human Resources within 31 days of the birth,
adoption, or placement.

HIPAA Special Enrollment Events

If you decline enrollment for Medical benefits for yourself or your eligible
dependents because of other health insurance or group health plan coverage,
you may be able to enroll yourself and your eligible dependents in the Medical
benefits provided under this Plan if you or your eligible dependents lose
eligibility for that other coverage (or if the other employer stops
contributing towards your or your dependents’ other coverage). However, you
must request enrollment within 31 days after you or your eligible dependents’
other coverage ends (or after the other employer stops contributing toward the
other coverage).

In addition, if you have a new dependent as a result of marriage, birth,
adoption, or placement for adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself, your
spouse and your new eligible dependent

  

* * *

7 SECTION 2  INTRODUCTION

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

children. However, you must request enrollment within 31 days after the
marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.

If you request a change due to a special enrollment event within the 31 day
timeframe, coverage will be effective the date of birth, adoption or placement
for adoption. For all other events, coverage will be effective the first of
the month following your request for enrollment.

The Plan must allow a HIPAA special enrollment for employees and dependents
who are eligible but not enrolled if they lose Medicaid or CHIP coverage
because they are no longer eligible, or they become eligible for a state’s
premium assistance program. Employees have 60 days from the date of the
Medicaid/CHIP event to request enrollment under the Plan.

If you request this change, coverage will be effective the first of the month
following your request for enrollment.  Specific restrictions may apply,
depending on federal and state law.

Changing Your Coverage

You may make coverage changes during the year only if you experience a change
in family status. The change in coverage must be consistent with the change in
status (e.g., you cover your Spouse following your marriage, your child
following an adoption, etc.). The following are considered family status
changes for purposes of the Plan:

  
  
  
•



your marriage, divorce, legal separation or annulment;  
  
  
  
  
•



the birth, adoption, placement for adoption or legal guardianship of a child;  
  
  
  
  
•



the death of a Dependent;  
  
  
  
  
•



your Dependent child no longer qualifying as an eligible Dependent or becomes
eligible for his or her own employer’s Plan;  
  
  
  
  
•



you or your eligible Dependent who were enrolled in an HMO no longer live or
work in that HMO's service area and no other benefit option is available to
you or your eligible Dependent;  
  
  
  
  
•



benefits are no longer offered by the Plan to a class of individuals that
include you or your eligible Dependent;  
  
  
  
  
•



a change in your or your Spouse's employment, position or work schedule that
impacts eligibility for health coverage, including termination of commencement
of employment, change from fulltime to parttime or vice versa, a strike or
lockout;  
  
  
  
  
•



a HIPAA Special Enrollment, including:  
  
  
  
  
\



loss of other coverage under another employer’s plan,  
  
  
  
  
\



loss of coverage due to the exhaustion of another employer's COBRA benefits,
provided you were paying for premiums on a timely basis,  
  
  
  
  
\



cessation of employer contributions under another plan (This is true even if
you or your eligible Dependent continues to receive coverage under the prior
Plan and to pay the amounts previously paid by the employer),  
  
  

* * *

8 SECTION 2  INTRODUCTION

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  
  
  
  
•



termination of your or your Dependent’s Medicaid or Children’s Health
Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage as a result of loss of eligibility (you must
contact Human Resources within 60 days of termination);  
  
  
  
  
•



you or your Dependent become eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under
Medicaid or CHIP (you must contact Human Resources within 60 days of
determination of subsidy eligibility);  
  
  
  
  
•



a court or administrative order;  
  
  
  
  
•



your spouse or Dependent child(ren) is employed and his or her employer’s plan
allows for a change in your family member’s coverage (either during that
employer’s Open Enrollment period or due to a midyear election change
permitted under the Internal Revenue Code), you may be able to make a
corresponding election change under the Plan. For example, if your spouse
elects family coverage during his or her employer’s open enrollment period,
you may request to end your coverage under the Plan;  
  
Unless otherwise noted above, if you wish to change your elections, you must
notify Human Resources within 31 days of the change in family status (60 days
for certain events as noted above). Otherwise, you will need to wait until the
next annual Open Enrollment.

While some of these changes in status are similar to qualifying events under
COBRA, you, or your eligible Dependent, do not need to elect COBRA
continuation coverage to take advantage of the special enrollment rights
listed above. These will also be available to you or your eligible Dependent
if COBRA is elected.

Consistency Requirements for Changes in Status

Except for election changes due to a HIPAA special enrollment, the changes you
make to your coverage must be “on account of and correspond with” the event.
To satisfy the “consistency rule,” both the event and the corresponding change
in coverage must meet all the following requirements:

  
  
  
•



Effect on eligibility:  The event must affect eligibility for coverage under
the Plan or under a plan sponsored by your dependent’s employer. This includes
any time you become eligible (or ineligible) for coverage or if the event
results in an increase or decrease in the number of your dependent child(ren)
who may benefit from coverage under the Plan.  
  
  
  
  
•



Corresponding election change:  The election change must correspond with the
event. For example, if your dependent child(ren) loses eligibility for
coverage under the terms of the health plan, you may cancel health coverage
only for that dependent child(ren). You may not cancel coverage for yourself
or other covered dependents.  
  
Note  :  Any child under age 26 who is placed with you for adoption will be
eligible for coverage on the date the child is placed with you, even if the
legal adoption is not yet final. If you do not legally adopt the child, all
medical Plan coverage for the child will end when the placement ends. No
provision will be made for continuing coverage (such as COBRA coverage) for
the child.

Change in Family Status  Example

Jane is married and has two children who qualify as Dependents. At annual Open
Enrollment, she elects not to participate in Kansas City Life Insurance
Company's medical Plan, because her husband, Tom, has family coverage under
his employer's medical Plan. In June, Tom loses his job as part of a
downsizing. As a result, Tom loses his eligibility for medical coverage. Due
to this family status change, Jane can elect family medical coverage under
Kansas City Life Insurance Company's medical Plan outside of annual Open
Enrollment.

Network and NonNetwork Benefits

As a participant in this Plan, you have the freedom to choose the Physician or
health care professional you prefer each time you need to receive Covered
Health Services. The choices you make affect the amounts you pay, as well as
the level of Benefits you receive and any benefit limitations that may apply.

You are eligible for the Network level of Benefits under this Plan when you
receive Covered Health Services from Physicians and other health care
professionals who have contracted with UnitedHealthcare to provide those
services. For facility services, these are Benefits for Covered Health
Services that are provided at a Network facility. Emergency Health Services,
including the services of either a Network or nonNetwork Emergency room
Physician, are always paid as Network Benefits. Covered Health Services
provided in a Network facility by a nonNetwork consulting Physician,
anesthesiologist, pathologist and radiologist will be paid as NonNetwork
Benefits.

Certain Physicians and providers have been identified as a Designated Facility
or Physician. Designated Network Benefits apply to Covered Health Services
that are provided by a Network Physician or other provider that is identified
as a Designated Facility or Physician. Designated Network Benefits are
available only for specific Covered Health Services as identified in Section
5,  Plan Highlights.

  

* * *

10 SECTION 2  INTRODUCTION

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

Generally, when you receive Covered Health Services from a Network provider,
you pay less than you would if you receive the same care from a nonNetwork
provider. Therefore, in most instances, your outofpocket expenses will be
less if you use a Network provider.

If you choose to seek care outside the Network, the Plan generally pays
Benefits at a lower level. You are required to pay the amount that exceeds the
Eligible Expense. The amount in excess of the Eligible Expense could be
significant, and this amount does not apply to the OutofPocket Maximum. You
may want to ask the nonNetwork provider about their billed charges before you
receive care. Emergency services received at a nonNetwork Hospital are
covered at the Network level.

* * *

Looking for a Network Provider?

In addition to other helpful information,  www.myuhc.com  , UnitedHealthcare's
consumer website, contains a directory of health care professionals and
facilities in UnitedHealthcare's Network. While Network status may change from
time to time,  www.myuhc.com  has the most current source of Network
information. Use  www.myuhc.com  to search for Physicians available in your
Plan.

* * *

Network Providers

UnitedHealthcare or its affiliates arrange for health care providers to
participate in a Network. At your request, UnitedHealthcare will send you a
directory of Network providers free of charge. Keep in mind, a provider's
Network status may change. To verify a provider's status or request a provider
directory, you can call UnitedHealthcare at the tollfree number on your ID
card or log onto  www.myuhc.com  .

Network providers are independent practitioners and are not employees of
Kansas City Life Insurance Company or UnitedHealthcare.

Possible Limitations on Provider Use

If UnitedHealthcare determines that you are using health care services in a
harmful or abusive manner, you may be required to select a Network Physician
to coordinate all of your future Covered Health Services. If you don't make a
selection within 31 days of the date you are notified, UnitedHealthcare will
select a Network Physician for you. In the event that you do not use the
Network Physician to coordinate all of your care, any Covered Health Services
you receive will be paid at the nonNetwork level.

Eligible Expenses

Eligible Expenses are charges for Covered Health Services that are provided
while the Plan is in effect, determined according to the definition in Section
14,  Glossary  . For certain Covered Health Services, the Plan will not pay
these expenses until you have met your Annual Deductible. Kansas City Life
Insurance Company has delegated to UnitedHealthcare the discretion and
authority to decide whether a treatment or supply is a Covered Health

  

* * *

11 SECTION 3 – HOW THE PLAN WORKS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

Service and how the Eligible Expenses will be determined and otherwise covered
under the Plan.

* * *

Don't Forget Your ID Card

Remember to show your UnitedHealthcare ID card every time you receive health
care services from a provider. If you do not show your ID card, a provider has
no way of knowing that you are enrolled under the Plan.

* * *

Annual Deductible

The Annual Deductible is the amount of Eligible Expenses you must pay each
calendar year for Covered Health Services before you are eligible to begin
receiving Benefits. There are separate Network and nonNetwork Annual
Deductibles for this Plan. The amounts you pay toward your Annual Deductible
accumulate over the course of the calendar year.

Amounts paid toward the Annual Deductible for Covered Health Services that are
subject to a visit or day limit will also be calculated against that maximum
benefit limit. As a result, the limited benefit will be reduced by the number
of days or visits you used toward meeting the Annual Deductible.

Copayment

A Copayment (Copay) is the amount you pay each time you receive certain
Covered Health Services. The Copay is a flat dollar amount and is paid at the
time of service or when billed by the provider. Copays do not count toward the
OutofPocketMaximum. Copays do not count toward the Annual Deductible. If
the Eligible Expense is less than the Copay, you are only responsible for
paying the Eligible Expense and not the Copay.

Coinsurance

Coinsurance is the percentage of Eligible Expenses that you are responsible
for paying. Coinsurance is a fixed percentage that applies to certain Covered
Health Services after you meet the Annual Deductible.

* * *

Coinsurance – Example

Let's assume that you receive Plan Benefits for outpatient surgery from a
Network provider. Since the Plan pays 80% after you meet the Annual
Deductible, you are responsible for paying the other 20%. This 20% is your
Coinsurance.

* * *

OutofPocket Maximum

The annual OutofPocket Maximum is the most you pay each calendar year for
Covered Health Services. There is a separate OutofPocket Maximum for Network
and NonNetwork Benefits. If your eligible outofpocket expenses in a
calendar year exceed the annual

  

* * *

12 SECTION 3 – HOW THE PLAN WORKS

maximum, the Plan pays 100% of Eligible Expenses for Covered Health Services
through the end of the calendar year.

Covered Health Services for which you need to contact Personal Health Support.  
  
* * *

UnitedHealthcare provides a program called Personal Health Support designed to
encourage personalized, efficient care for you and your covered Dependents.

Personal Health Support Nurses center their efforts on prevention, education,
and closing any gaps in your care. The goal of the program is to ensure you
receive the most appropriate and costeffective services available. A Personal
Health Support Nurse is notified when you or your provider calls the tollfree
number on your ID card regarding an upcoming treatment or service.

If you are living with a chronic condition or dealing with complex health care
needs, UnitedHealthcare may assign to you a primary nurse, referred to as a
Personal Health Support Nurse to guide you through your treatment. This
assigned nurse will answer questions, explain options, identify your needs,
and may refer you to specialized care programs. The Personal Health Support
Nurse will provide you with their telephone number so you can call them with
questions about your conditions, or your overall health and wellbeing.

Personal Health Support Nurses will provide a variety of different services to
help you and your covered family members receive appropriate medical care.
Program components and

  

* * *

13 SECTION 3 – HOW THE PLAN WORKS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

notification requirements are subject to change without notice. As of the
publication of this SPD, the Personal Health Support program includes:

  
  
  
•



Admission counseling  \ For upcoming inpatient Hospital admissions for
certain conditions, a Treatment Decision Support Nurse may call you to help
answer your questions and to make sure you have the information and support
you need for a successful recovery.  
  
  
  
  
•



Inpatient care advocacy  \ If you are hospitalized, a nurse will work with
your Physician to make sure you are getting the care you need and that your
Physician's treatment Plan is being carried out effectively.  
  
  
  
  
•



Readmission Management  \ This program serves as a bridge between the
Hospital and your home if you are at high risk of being readmitted. After
leaving the Hospital, if you have a certain chronic or complex condition, you
may receive a phone call from a Personal Health Support Nurse to confirm that
medications, needed equipment, or followup services are in place. The
Personal Health Support Nurse will also share important health care
information, reiterate and reinforce discharge instructions, and support a
safe transition home.  
  
  
  
  
•



Risk Management  \ Designed for participants with certain chronic or complex
conditions, this program addresses such health care needs as access to medical
specialists, medication information, and coordination of equipment and
supplies. Participants may receive a phone call from a Personal Health Support
Nurse to discuss and share important health care information related to the
participant's specific chronic or complex condition.  
  
If you do not receive a call from a Personal Health Support Nurse but feel you
could benefit from any of these programs, please call the tollfree number on
your ID card.

Requirements for Notifying Personal Health Support

There are some Network Benefits for which you are responsible for notifying
Personal Health Support. However, Network providers are generally responsible
for notifying Personal Health Support before they provide these services to
you.

When you choose to receive certain Covered Health Services from nonNetwork
providers, you are responsible for notifying Personal Health Support before
you receive these Covered Health Services. In many cases, your NonNetwork
Benefits will be reduced if Personal Health Support is not notified.

The services that require Personal Health Support notification are:

  
  
  
•



ambulance – nonemergent air and ground;  
  
  
  
  
•



Congenital Heart Disease services;

Special Note Regarding Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services

You must provide preservice notification as described below. You are not

Network providers. Network providers are responsible for notifying the Mental
Health/Substance Use Disorder Administrator before they provide these services
to you.

services require notification:

  
  
  
•



Mental Health Services  inpatient services (including Partial

possible for nonscheduled admissions (including Emergency admissions). If you

Special Note Regarding Medicare

Covered Health Services. Since Medicare pays benefits first, the Plan will pay
Benefits second as described in Section 10,  Coordination of Benefits (COB)  .

Ambulance Services

The Plan covers Emergency ambulance services and transportation provided by a
licensed ambulance service to the nearest Hospital that offers Emergency
Health Services. See Section 14,  Glossary  for the definition of Emergency.

Ambulance service by air is covered in an Emergency if ground transportation
is impossible, or would put your life or health in serious jeopardy. If
special circumstances exist, UnitedHealthcare may pay Benefits for Emergency
air transportation to a Hospital that is not the closest facility to provide
Emergency Health Services.

When transportation is initiated by UnitedHealthcare from a nonnetwork
Hospital to a network Hospital when the member was admitted in an emergency
life threatening situation and is later stabilized, the ambulance fee will be
waived.

The Plan also covers transportation provided by a licensed professional
ambulance, (either ground or air ambulance, as UnitedHealthcare determines
appropriate) between facilities when the transport is:

  
  
  
■



from a nonNetwork Hospital to a Network Hospital;  
  
  
  
  
■



to a Hospital that provides a higher level of care that was not available at
the original Hospital;  
  
  
  
  
■



to a more costeffective acute care facility; or  
  
  
  
  
■



from an acute facility to a subacute setting.

Note:  Prosthetic devices are different from DME  see  Durable Medical
Equipment (DME)  in this section.

Reconstructive Procedures

Reconstructive Procedures are services performed when the primary purpose of
the procedure is either to treat a medical condition or to improve or restore
physiologic function for an organ or body part. Reconstructive procedures
include surgery or other procedures which are associated with an Injury,
Sickness or Congenital Anomaly. The primary result of the procedure is not a
changed or improved physical appearance.

Improving or restoring physiologic function means that the organ or body part
is made to work better. An example of a Reconstructive Procedure is surgery on
the inside of the nose so that a person's breathing can be improved or
restored.

Benefits for Reconstructive Procedures include breast reconstruction following
a mastectomy and reconstruction of the nonaffected breast to achieve
symmetry. Replacement of an existing breast implant is covered by the Plan if
the initial breast implant followed mastectomy. Other services required by the
Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, including breast prostheses and
treatment of complications, are provided in the same manner and at the same
level as those for any other Covered Health Service. You can contact
UnitedHealthcare at the telephone number on your ID card for more information
about Benefits for mastectomyrelated services.

There may be times when the primary purpose of a procedure is to make a body
part work better. However, in other situations, the purpose of the same
procedure is to improve the appearance of a body part. Cosmetic procedures are
excluded from coverage. Procedures that correct an anatomical Congenital
Anomaly without improving or restoring physiologic function are considered
Cosmetic Procedures. A good example is upper eyelid surgery. At times, this
procedure will be done to improve vision, which is considered a Reconstructive
Procedure. In other cases, improvement in appearance is the primary intended
purpose, which is considered a Cosmetic Procedure. This Plan does not provide
Benefits for Cosmetic Procedures, as defined in Section 14,  Glossary  .

The fact that a Covered Person may suffer psychological consequences or
socially avoidant behavior as a result of an Injury, Sickness or Congenital
Anomaly does not classify surgery (or other procedures done to relieve such
consequences or behavior) as a reconstructive procedure.

* * *

Please remember that you must notify Personal Health Support five business
days before undergoing a Reconstructive Procedure. When you provide
notification, Personal Health Support can determine whether the service is
considered reconstructive or cosmetic.

SECTION 9  CLAIMS PROCEDURES

* * *

What this section includes:

  
  
  
■



How Network and nonNetwork claims work; and  
  
  
  
  
■



What to do if your claim is denied, in whole or in part.  
  
* * *

Network Benefits

In general, if you receive Covered Health Services from a Network provider,
UnitedHealthcare will pay the Physician or facility directly. If a Network
provider bills you for any Covered Health Service other than your Copay or
Coinsurance, please contact the provider or call UnitedHealthcare at the phone
number on your ID card for assistance.

Keep in mind, you are responsible for meeting the Annual Deductible and paying
any Copay or Coinsurance owed to a Network provider at the time of service, or
when you receive a bill from the provider.

NonNetwork Benefits

If you receive a bill for Covered Health Services from a nonNetwork provider,
you (or the provider if they prefer) must send the bill to UnitedHealthcare
for processing. To make sure the claim is processed promptly and accurately, a
completed claim form must be attached and mailed to UnitedHealthcare at the
address on the back of your ID card.

Prescription Drug Benefit Claims

If you wish to receive reimbursement for a prescription, you may submit a
postservice claim as described in this section if:

  
  
  
■



you are asked to pay the full cost of the Prescription Drug when you fill it
and you believe that the Plan should have paid for it; or  
  
  
  
  
■



you pay a Copay and you believe that the amount of the Copay was incorrect.  
  
If a pharmacy (retail or mail order) fails to fill a prescription that you
have presented and you believe that it is a Covered Health Service, you may
submit a preservice request for Benefits as described in this section.

If Your Provider Does Not File Your Claim

You can obtain a claim form by visiting  www.myuhc.com  , calling the toll
free number on your ID card or contacting Human Resources. If you do not have
a claim form, simply attach a brief letter of explanation to the bill, and
verify that the bill contains the information listed below. If any of these
items are missing from the bill, you can include them in your letter:

  

* * *

71 SECTION 8  EXCLUSIONS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  
  
  
  
■



your name and address;  
  
  
  
  
■



the patient's name, age and relationship to the Participant;  
  
  
  
  
■



the number as shown on your ID card;  
  
  
  
  
■



the name, address and tax identification number of the provider of the
service(s);  
  
  
  
  
■



a diagnosis from the Physician;  
  
  
  
  
■



the date of service;  
  
  
  
  
■



an itemized bill from the provider that includes:  
  
  
  
  
\



the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes;  
  
  
  
  
\



a description of, and the charge for, each service;  
  
  
  
  
\



the date the Sickness or Injury began; and  
  
  
  
  
\



a statement indicating either that you are, or you are not, enrolled for
coverage under any other health insurance Plan or program. If you are enrolled
for other coverage you must include the name and address of the other
carrier(s).  
  
Failure to provide all the information listed above may delay any
reimbursement that may be due you.

The above information should be filed with UnitedHealthcare at the address on
your ID card. When filing a claim for Outpatient Prescription Drug Benefits,
submit your claim to the pharmacy benefit manager claims address noted on your
ID card.

After UnitedHealthcare has processed your claim, you will receive payment for
Benefits that the Plan allows. It is your responsibility to pay the non
Network provider the charges you incurred, including any difference between
what you were billed and what the Plan paid.

UnitedHealthcare will pay Benefits to you unless:

  
  
  
■



the provider notifies UnitedHealthcare that you have provided signed
authorization to assign Benefits directly to that provider; or  
  
  
  
  
■



you make a written request for the nonNetwork provider to be paid directly at
the time you submit your claim.  
  
UnitedHealthcare will only pay Benefits to you or, with written authorization
by you, your provider, and not to a third party, even if your provider has
assigned Benefits to that third party.

Health Statements

Each month in which UnitedHealthcare processes at least one claim for you or a
covered Dependent, you will receive a Health Statement in the mail. Health
Statements make it easy for you to manage your family's medical costs by
providing claims information in easytounderstand terms.

* * *

  

If you would rather track claims for yourself and your covered Dependents
online, you may do so at  www.myuhc.com  . You may also elect to discontinue
receipt of paper Health Statements by making the appropriate selection on this
site.

Explanation of Benefits (EOB)

You may request that UnitedHealthcare send you a paper copy of an Explanation
of Benefits (EOB) after processing the claim. The EOB will let you know if
there is any portion of the claim you need to pay. If any claims are denied in
whole or in part, the EOB will include the reason for the denial or partial
payment. If you would like paper copies of the EOBs, you may call the toll
free number on your ID card to request them. You can also view and print all
of your EOBs online at  www.myuhc.com  . See Section 14,  Glossary  for the
definition of Explanation of Benefits.

* * *

Important  Timely Filing of Claims

All Network claim forms must be submitted within 12 months after the date of
service. Otherwise, the Plan will not pay any Benefits for that Eligible
Expense, or Benefits will be reduced, as determined by UnitedHealthcare. This
12month requirement does not apply if you are legally incapacitated. All Non
Network Claims must be filed no later than March 31  st  following the close
of the Plan year. If your claim relates to an Inpatient Stay, the date of
service is the date your Inpatient Stay ends.

* * *

Initial Claim Determination

The Plan has a specific amount of time, by law, to evaluate and respond to
claims for benefits covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA). The period of time the Plan has to evaluate and respond to a
claim begins on the date the Plan receives the claim as it is shown on the
charts in this section.

Adverse Benefit Determination

If the Plan does not fully agree with your claim, you will receive an “adverse
benefit determination” — a denial, reduction, or termination of a benefit, or
failure to provide or pay for (in whole or in part) a benefit. An adverse
benefit determination includes a decision to deny benefits based on:

  
  
  
■



An individual being ineligible to participate in the Plan;  
  
  
  
  
■



Utilization review;  
  
  
  
  
■



A service being characterized as experimental or investigational or not
medically necessary or appropriate; and  
  
  
  
  
■



A concurrent care decision.  
  
In the event of an adverse benefit determination, the claimant will receive
notice of the determination. The notice will include:

  

* * *

73 SECTION 9  CLAIMS PROCEDURES

■



The specific reasons for the adverse determination;

■



A request for any additional information needed to reconsider the claim and
the reason this information is needed;  
  
  
  
  
■



A description of the plan’s review procedures and the time limits applicable
to such procedures;  
  
  
  
  
■



A statement of your right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of
ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review;  
  
  
  
  
■



If any internal rules, guidelines, protocols or similar criteria was used as a
basis for the adverse determination, either the specific rule, guideline,
protocols or other similar criteria or a statement that a copy of such
information will be made available free of charge upon request;  
  
  
  
  
■



For adverse determinations based on medical necessity, experimental treatment
or other similar exclusions or limits, an explanation of the scientific or
clinical judgment used in the decision, or a statement that an explanation
will be provided free of charge upon request; and  
  
  
  
  
■



For adverse determinations involving urgent care, a description of the
expedited review process for such claims. This notice can be provided orally
within the timeframe for the expedited process, as long as written notice is
provided no later than 3 days after the oral notice.  
  
Claim Denials and Appeals

If Your Claim is Denied

If a claim for Benefits is denied in part or in whole, you may call
UnitedHealthcare at the number on your ID card before requesting a formal
appeal. If UnitedHealthcare cannot resolve the issue to your satisfaction over
the phone, you have the right to file a formal appeal as described below.

How to Appeal a Denied Claim

If you wish to appeal a denied preservice request for Benefits, postservice
claim or a rescission of coverage as described below, you or your authorized
representative must submit your appeal in writing within 180 days of receiving
the adverse benefit determination. You do not need to submit Urgent Care
appeals in writing. This communication should include:

  
  
  
■



the patient's name and ID number as shown on the ID card;  
  
  
  
  
■



the provider's name;  
  
  
  
  
■



the date of medical service;

You or your enrolled Dependent may send a written request for an appeal to:

UnitedHealthcare  Appeals  
P.O. Box 30432  
Salt Lake City, UT 841300432

For Urgent Care requests for Benefits that have been denied, you or your

* * *

Types of claims

The timing of the claims appeal process is based on the type of claim you are
appealing. If you wish to appeal a claim, it helps to understand whether it is
an:

  
  
  
■



urgent care request for Benefits;  
  
  
  
  
■



preservice request for Benefits;  
  
  
  
  
■



postservice claim; or  
  
  
  
  
■



concurrent claim.  
  
* * *

Review of an Appeal

UnitedHealthcare will conduct a full and fair review of your appeal. The
appeal may be reviewed by:

  
  
  
■



an appropriate individual(s) who did not make the initial benefit
determination and who is not the subordinate of that individual; and  
  
  
  
  
■



a health care professional with appropriate expertise who was not consulted
during the initial benefit determination process. No deference will be
afforded to the initial adverse benefit determination.  
  
Once the review is complete, if UnitedHealthcare upholds the denial, you will
receive a written explanation of the reasons and facts relating to the denial.
The notice will contain the following information:

  
  
  
■



The specific reason for the adverse determination on review;  
  
  
  
  
■



Reference to the specific provisions of the Plan on which the determination is
based;  
  
  
  
  
■



A statement that you are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge,
reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other
information relevant to the claim for benefits;  
  
  
  
  
■



A description of your right to bring a civil action under ERISA following an
adverse determination on review;  
  
  
  
  
■

criteria or a statement that a copy of such information will be made available
free of charge upon request; (for health and disability claims)

  
  
  
■



For adverse determinations based on medical necessity, experimental treatment
or other similar exclusions or limits, an explanation of the scientific or
clinical judgment used in the decision, or a statement that an explanation
will be provided free of charge upon request; (for health and disability
claims) and  
  
  
  
  
■



A description of the voluntary appeals procedure under the Plan, if any, and
your right to obtain additional information upon request about such
procedures.  
  
Filing a Second Appeal

Your Plan offers two levels of appeal. If you are not satisfied with the first
level appeal decision, you have the right to request a second level appeal
from UnitedHealthcare within 60 days from receipt of the first level appeal
determination. UnitedHealthcare must notify you of the appeal determination
within 15 days after receiving the completed appeal for a preservice denial
and 30 days after receiving the completed postservice appeal.

Appeals that do require clinical review will be sent by UnitedHealthcare to an
independent review organization. If the adverse benefit determination was
based in whole or part on a medical judgment, the independent review
organization will consult with a health care professional that has appropriate
training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical
judgment. The health care professional consulted for this purpose may not be
the individual consulted by the Claims Administrator in the first level
appeal, or a subordinate of such individual.

Note:  Upon written request and free of charge, any Covered Persons may
examine documents relevant to their claim and/or appeals and submit opinions
and comments. UnitedHealthcare will review all claims in accordance with the
rules established by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Federal External Review Program

If, after exhausting your internal appeals, you are not satisfied with the
determination made by UnitedHealthcare, or if UnitedHealthcare fails to
respond to your appeal in accordance with applicable regulations regarding
timing, you may be entitled to request an external review of
UnitedHealthcare’s determination. The process is available at no charge to
you.

If one of the above conditions is met, you may request an external review of
adverse benefit determinations based upon any of the following:

■ clinical reasons;

  
  
  
■



the exclusions for Experimental or Investigational Services or Unproven
Services;  
  
  
  
  
■



rescission of coverage (coverage that was cancelled or discontinued
retroactively); or  
  
  
  
  
■



as otherwise required by applicable law.  
  
  

* * *

76 SECTION 9  CLAIMS PROCEDURES

You or your representative may request a standard external review by sending a
written request to the address set out in the determination letter. You or
your representative may request an expedited external review, in urgent
situations as detailed below, by calling the tollfree number on your ID card
or by sending a written request to the address set out in the determination
letter. A request must be made within four months after the date you received
UnitedHealthcare’s decision.

An external review request should include all of the following:

  
  
  
■



a specific request for an external review;  
  
  
  
  
■



the Covered Person's name, address, and insurance ID number;  
  
  
  
  
■



your designated representative's name and address, when applicable;  
  
  
  
  
■



the service that was denied; and  
  
  
  
  
■



any new, relevant information that was not provided during the internal
appeal.  
  
An external review will be performed by an Independent Review Organization
(IRO). UnitedHealthcare has entered into agreements with three or more IROs
that have agreed to perform such reviews. There are two types of external
reviews available:

  
  
  
■



a standard external review; and  
  
  
  
  
■



an expedited external review.  
  
Standard External Review

A standard external review is comprised of all of the following:

  
  
  
■



a preliminary review by UnitedHealthcare of the request;  
  
  
  
  
■



a referral of the request by UnitedHealthcare to the IRO; and  
  
  
  
  
■



a decision by the IRO.  
  
Within the applicable timeframe after receipt of the request, UnitedHealthcare
will complete a preliminary review to determine whether the individual for
whom the request was submitted meets all of the following:

  
  
  
■



is or was covered under the Plan at the time the health care service or
procedure that is at issue in the request was provided;  
  
  
  
  
■



has exhausted the applicable internal appeals process; and  
  
  
  
  
■



has provided all the information and forms required so that UnitedHealthcare
may process the request.  
  
After UnitedHealthcare completes the preliminary review, UnitedHealthcare will
issue a notification in writing to you. If the request is eligible for
external review, UnitedHealthcare will assign an IRO to conduct such review.
UnitedHealthcare will assign requests by either rotating claims assignments
among the IROs or by using a random selection process.

  

* * *

77 SECTION 9  CLAIMS PROCEDURES

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

The IRO will notify you in writing of the request’s eligibility and acceptance
for external review. You may submit in writing to the IRO within ten business
days following the date of receipt of the notice additional information that
the IRO will consider when conducting the external review. The IRO is not
required to, but may, accept and consider additional information submitted by
you after ten business days.

UnitedHealthcare will provide to the assigned IRO the documents and
information considered in making UnitedHealthcare’s determination. The
documents include:

  
  
  
■



all relevant medical records;  
  
  
  
  
■



all other documents relied upon by UnitedHealthcare; and  
  
  
  
  
■



all other information or evidence that you or your Physician submitted. If
there is any information or evidence you or your Physician wish to submit that
was not previously provided, you may include this information with your
external review request and UnitedHealthcare will include it with the
documents forwarded to the IRO.  
  
In reaching a decision, the IRO will review the claim anew and not be bound by
any decisions or conclusions reached by UnitedHealthcare. The IRO will provide
written notice of its determination (the “Final External Review Decision”)
within 45 days after it receives the request for the external review (unless
they request additional time and you agree). The IRO will deliver the notice
of Final External Review Decision to you and UnitedHealthcare, and it will
include the clinical basis for the determination.

Upon receipt of a Final External Review Decision reversing UnitedHealthcare’s
determination, the Plan will immediately provide coverage or payment for the
benefit claim at issue in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Plan, and any applicable law regarding plan remedies. If the Final External
Review Decision is that payment or referral will not be made, the Plan will
not be obligated to provide Benefits for the health care service or procedure.

Expedited External Review

An expedited external review is similar to a standard external review. The
most significant difference between the two is that the time periods for
completing certain portions of the review process are much shorter, and in
some instances you may file an expedited external review before completing the
internal appeals process.

You may make a written or verbal request for an expedited external review if
you receive either of the following:

  
  
  
■



an adverse benefit determination of a claim or appeal if the adverse benefit
determination involves a medical condition for which the time frame for
completion of an expedited internal appeal would seriously jeopardize the life
or health of the individual or would jeopardize the individual’s ability to
regain maximum function and you have filed a request for an expedited internal
appeal; or  
  
  

* * *

78 SECTION 9  CLAIMS PROCEDURES

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  
  
  
  
■



a final appeal decision, if the determination involves a medical condition
where the timeframe for completion of a standard external review would
seriously jeopardize the life or health of the individual or would jeopardize
the individual’s ability to regain maximum function, or if the final appeal
decision concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or
health care service, procedure or product for which the individual received
emergency services, but has not been discharged from a facility.  
  
Immediately upon receipt of the request, UnitedHealthcare will determine
whether the individual meets both of the following:

  
  
  
■



is or was covered under the Plan at the time the health care service or
procedure that is at issue in the request was provided.  
  
  
  
  
■



has provided all the information and forms required so that UnitedHealthcare
may process the request.  
  
After UnitedHealthcare completes the review, UnitedHealthcare will immediately
send a notice in writing to you. Upon a determination that a request is
eligible for expedited external review, UnitedHealthcare will assign an IRO in
the same manner UnitedHealthcare utilizes to assign standard external reviews
to IROs. UnitedHealthcare will provide all necessary documents and information
considered in making the adverse benefit determination or final adverse
benefit determination to the assigned IRO electronically or by telephone or
facsimile or any other available expeditious method. The IRO, to the extent
the information or documents are available and the IRO considers them
appropriate, must consider the same type of information and documents
considered in a standard external review.

In reaching a decision, the IRO will review the claim anew and not be bound by
any decisions or conclusions reached by UnitedHealthcare. The IRO will provide
notice of the final external review decision for an expedited external review
as expeditiously as the claimant’s medical condition or circumstances require,
but in no event more than 72 hours after the IRO receives the request. If the
initial notice is not in writing, within 48 hours after the date of providing
the initial notice, the assigned IRO will provide written confirmation of the
decision to you and to UnitedHealthcare.

You may contact UnitedHealthcare at the tollfree UnitedHealthcare number on
your ID card for more information regarding external review rights, or if
making a verbal request for an expedited external review.

Timing of Appeals Determinations

Separate schedules apply to the timing of claims appeals, depending on the
type of claim. There are three types of claims:

Concurrent Care Claims

If an ongoing course of treatment was previously approved for a specific
period of time or number of treatments, and your request to extend the
treatment is an Urgent Care request for Benefits as defined above, your
request will be decided within 24 hours, provided your request is made at
least 24 hours prior to the end of the approved treatment. UnitedHealthcare
will make a determination on your request for the extended treatment within 24
hours from receipt of your request.

If your request for extended treatment is not made at least 24 hours prior to
the end of the approved treatment, the request will be treated as an Urgent
Care request for Benefits and decided according to the timeframes described
above. If an ongoing course of treatment was previously approved for a
specific period of time or number of treatments, and you request to extend
treatment in a nonurgent circumstance, your request will be considered a new
request and decided according to postservice or preservice timeframes,
whichever applies.

Limitation of Action

You cannot bring any legal action against Kansas City Life Insurance Company
or the Claims Administrator to recover reimbursement until 90 days after you
have properly submitted a request for reimbursement as described in this
section and all required reviews of your claim have been completed. If you
want to bring a legal action against Kansas City Life Insurance Company or the
Claims Administrator, you must do so within three years from the expiration of
the time period in which a request for reimbursement must be submitted or you
lose any rights to bring such an action against Kansas City Life Insurance

the steps in the appeal process described in this section. After completing
that process, if you want to bring a legal action against Kansas City Life
Insurance Company or the Claims Administrator you must do so within three
years of the date you are notified of our final decision on your appeal or you
lose any rights to bring such an action against Kansas City Life Insurance
Company or the Claims Administrator.

Coordination of Benefits (COB) applies to you if you are covered by more than
one health benefits Plan, including any one of the following:

  
  
  
■



another employer sponsored health benefits Plan;  
  
  
  
  
■



a medical component of a group longterm care Plan, such as skilled nursing
care;  
  
  
  
  
■



nofault or traditional "fault" type medical payment benefits or personal
injury protection benefits under an auto insurance policy;  
  
  
  
  
■



medical payment benefits under any premises liability or other types of
liability coverage; or  
  
  
  
  
■



Medicare or other governmental health benefit.  
  
If coverage is provided under two or more Plans, COB determines which Plan is
primary and which Plan is secondary. The Plan considered primary pays its
benefits first, without regard to the possibility that another Plan may cover
some expenses. Any remaining expenses may be paid under the other Plan, which
is considered secondary. The secondary Plan may determine its benefits based
on the benefits paid by the primary Plan.

* * *

Don't forget to update your Dependents' Medical Coverage Information

Avoid delays on your Dependent claims by updating your Dependent's medical
coverage information. Just log on to  www.myuhc.com  or call the tollfree
number on your ID card to update your COB information. You will need the name
of your Dependent's other medical coverage, along with the policy number.

* * *

Determining Which Plan is Primary

If you are covered by two or more Plans, the benefit payment follows the rules
below in this order:

  
  
  
■



this Plan will always be secondary to medical payment coverage or personal
injury protection coverage under any auto liability or nofault insurance
policy;  
  
  
  
  
■



when you have coverage under two or more medical Plans and only one has COB
provisions, the Plan without COB provisions will pay benefits first;  
  
  
  
  
■



a Plan that covers a person as a Participant pays benefits before a Plan that
covers the person as a Dependent;  
  
  
  
  
■



if you are receiving COBRA continuation coverage under another employer Plan,
this Plan will pay Benefits first;  
  
  
  
  
■



your Dependent children will receive primary coverage from the parent whose
birth date occurs first in a calendar year. If both parents have the same
birth date, the Plan that pays benefits first is the one that has been in
effect the longest. This birthday rule applies only if:

\



the parents are married or living together whether or not they have ever been
married and not legally separated; or  
  
  
  
  
\



a court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the
responsibility to provide health care coverage;  
  
  
  
  
■



if two or more Plans cover a Dependent child of divorced or separated parents
and if there is no court decree stating that one parent is responsible for
health care, the child will be covered under the Plan of:  
  
  
  
  
\



the parent with custody of the child; then  
  
  
  
  
\



the Spouse of the parent with custody of the child; then  
  
  
  
  
\



the parent not having custody of the child; then  
  
  
  
  
\



the Spouse of the parent not having custody of the child;  
  
  
  
  
■



Plans for active Participants pay before Plans covering laidoff or retired
Participants;  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan that has covered the individual claimant the longest will pay first;
The expenses must be covered in part under at least one of the Plans; and  
  
  
  
  
■



finally, if none of the above rules determines which Plan is primary or
secondary, the allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans
meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than
it would have paid had it been the primary Plan.  
  
The following examples illustrate how the Plan determines which Plan pays
first and which Plan pays second.

* * *

Determining Primary and Secondary Plan – Examples

1)  Let's say you and your Spouse both have family medical coverage through
your respective employers. You are unwell and go to see a Physician. Since
you're covered as a Participant under this Plan, and as a Dependent under your
Spouse's Plan, this Plan will pay Benefits for the Physician's office visit
first.

2) Again, let's say you and your Spouse both have family medical coverage
through your respective employers. You take your Dependent child to see a
Physician. This Plan will look at your birthday and your Spouse's birthday to
determine which Plan pays first. If you were born on June 11 and your Spouse
was born on May 30, your Spouse's Plan will pay first.

* * *

When This Plan is Secondary

If this Plan is secondary, it determines the amount it will pay for a Covered
Health Service by following the steps below.

  
  
  
■



the Plan determines the amount it would have paid had it been the only Plan
involved.  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan pays the entire difference between the allowable expense and the
amount paid by the primary Plan – as long as this amount is not more than the
Plan would have paid had it been the only Plan involved.  
  
  

* * *

85 SECTION 10  COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

The maximum combined payment you may receive from all Plans cannot exceed 100%
of the total allowable expense. See the textbox below for the definition of
allowable expense.

Determining the Allowable Expense When This Plan is Secondary

When this Plan is secondary, the allowable expense is the primary Plan's
Network rate. If the primary Plan bases its reimbursement on reasonable and
customary charges, the allowable expense is the primary Plan's reasonable and
customary charge. If both the primary Plan and this Plan do not have a
contracted rate, the allowable expense will be the greater of the two Plans'
reasonable and customary charges.

* * *

What is an allowable expense?

For purposes of COB, an allowable expense is a health care expense that is
covered at least in part by one of the health benefit Plans covering you.

* * *

When a Covered Person Qualifies for Medicare

Determining Which Plan is Primary

To the extent permitted by law, this Plan will pay Benefits second to Medicare
when you become eligible for Medicare, even if you don't elect it. There are,
however, Medicareeligible individuals for whom the Plan pays Benefits first
and Medicare pays benefits second:

  
  
  
■



employees with active current employment status age 65 or older and their
Spouses age 65 or older; and  
  
  
  
  
■



individuals with endstage renal disease, for a limited period of time.  
  
Determining the Allowable Expense When This Plan is Secondary

If this Plan is secondary to Medicare, the Medicare approved amount is the
allowable expense, as long as the provider accepts Medicare. If the provider
does not accept Medicare, the Medicare limiting charge (the most a provider
can charge you if they don't accept Medicare) will be the allowable expense.
Medicare payments, combined with Plan Benefits, will not exceed 100% of the
total allowable expense.

If you are eligible for, but not enrolled in, Medicare, and this Plan is
secondary to Medicare, Benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced by the
amount that would have been paid if you had been enrolled in Medicare.

Medicare CrossOver Program

The Plan offers a Medicare Crossover Program for Medicare Part A claims. If
you enroll for this program, you no longer have to file a separate claim with
the Plan to receive secondary benefits for these expenses.

  

* * *

86 SECTION 10  COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

Once the Medicare Part A carrier[s] have reimbursed your health care provider,
the Medicare carrier will electronically submit the necessary information to
the Claims Administrator to process the balance of your claim under the
provisions of this Plan.

To participate in the Medicare Crossover Program, you must complete a special
form authorizing this service and submit it to the Claims Administrator. Your
Spouse also can enroll for this program, as long as he or she is eligible for
Medicare and this Plan is your only secondary medical coverage.

You can verify that the automated crossover is in place when your copy of the
explanation of Medicare benefits (EOMB) states your claim has been forwarded
to your secondary carrier. Until this message appears, you must continue to
file secondary claims with the Claims Administrator.

This crossover process does not apply to expenses under Part A of Medicare
(hospital expenses) expenses that Medicare does not cover. You must continue
to file claims for these expenses.

For information about enrollment or if you have questions about the program,
call the telephone number listed on the back of your ID card.

Right to Receive and Release Needed Information

Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply
these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under this Plan and other
Plans. The Plan Administrator may get the facts needed from, or give them to,
other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and
determining benefits payable under this Plan and other Plans covering the
person claiming benefits.

The Plan Administrator does not need to tell, or get the consent of, any
person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under this Plan must give
UnitedHealthcare any facts needed to apply those rules and determine benefits
payable. If you do not provide UnitedHealthcare the information needed to
apply these rules and determine the Benefits payable, your claim for Benefits
will be denied.

Overpayment and Underpayment of Benefits

If you are covered under more than one medical Plan, there is a possibility
that the other Plan will pay a benefit that UnitedHealthcare should have paid.
If this occurs, the Plan may pay the other Plan the amount owed.

If the Plan pays you more than it owes under this COB provision, you should
pay the excess back promptly. Otherwise, the Company may recover the amount in
the form of salary, wages, or benefits payable under any Companysponsored
benefit Plans, including this Plan. The Company also reserves the right to
recover any overpayment by legal action or offset payments on future Eligible
Expenses.

  

* * *

87 SECTION 10  COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

If the Plan overpays a health care provider, UnitedHealthcare reserves the
right to recover the excess amount, by legal action if necessary.

Refund of Overpayments

If Kansas City Life Insurance Company pays for Benefits for expenses incurred
on account of a Covered Person, that Covered Person, or any other person or
organization that was paid, must make a refund to Kansas City Life Insurance
Company if:

  
  
  
■



all or some of the expenses were not paid by the Covered Person or did not
legally have to be paid by the Covered Person;  
  
  
  
  
■



all or some of the payment Kansas City Life Insurance Company made exceeded
the Benefits under the Plan; or  
  
  
  
  
■



all or some of the payment was made in error.  
  
The refund equals the amount Kansas City Life Insurance Company paid in excess
of the amount that should have paid under the Plan. If the refund is due from
another person or organization, the Covered Person agrees to help Kansas City
Life Insurance Company get the refund when requested.

If the Covered Person, or any other person or organization that was paid, does
not promptly refund the full amount, Kansas City Life Insurance Company may
reduce the amount of any future Benefits for the Covered Person that are
payable under the Plan. The reductions will equal the amount of the required
refund. Kansas City Life Insurance Company may have other rights in addition
to the right to reduce future Benefits.

What this section includes:

  
  
  
■



How your Benefits are impacted if you suffer a Sickness or Injury caused by a
third party.

The Plan has a right to subrogation and reimbursement, as defined below.

Right of Recovery

The Plan has the right to recover benefits it has paid on you or your
Dependent's behalf that were:

  
  
  
■



made in error;  
  
  
  
  
■



due to a mistake in fact;  
  
  
  
  
■



advanced during the time period of meeting the calendar year Deductible; or  
  
  
  
  
■



advanced during the time period of meeting the OutofPocket Maximum for the
calendar year.  
  
  

* * *

88 SECTION 10  COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

Benefits paid because you or your Dependent misrepresented facts are also
subject to recovery.

If the Plan provides a Benefit for you or your Dependent that exceeds the
amount that should have been paid, the Plan will:

  
  
  
■



require that the overpayment be returned when requested, or  
  
  
  
  
■



reduce a future benefit payment for you or your Dependent by the amount of the
overpayment.  
  
If the Plan provides an advancement of benefits to you or your Dependent
during the time period of the Deductible and/or meeting the OutofPocket
Maximum for the calendar year, the Plan will send you or your Dependent a
monthly statement identifying the amount you owe with payment instructions.
The Plan has the right to recover Benefits it has advanced by:

  
  
  
■



submitting a reminder letter to you or a covered Dependent that details any
outstanding balance owed to the Plan; and  
  
  
  
  
■



conducting courtesy calls to you or a covered Dependent to discuss any
outstanding balance owed to the Plan.  
  
Right to Subrogation

The right to subrogation means the Plan is substituted to and shall succeed to
any and all legal claims that you may be entitled to pursue against any third
party for Benefits that the Plan has paid. Subrogation applies when the Plan
has paid on your behalf Benefits for a Sickness or Injury for which a third
party is considered responsible, e.g. an insurance carrier if you are involved
in an auto accident.

The Plan shall be subrogated to, and shall succeed to, all rights of recovery
from any or all third parties, under any legal theory of any type, for 100
percent of any services and Benefits the Plan has paid on your behalf relating
to any Sickness or Injury caused by any third party.

Right to Reimbursement

The right to reimbursement means that if a third party causes a Sickness or
Injury for which you receive a settlement, judgment, or other recovery, you
must use those proceeds to fully return to the Plan 100% of any Benefits you
received for that Sickness or Injury.

Third Parties

The following persons and entities are considered third parties:

  
  
  
■



a person or entity alleged to have caused you to suffer a Sickness, Injury or
damages, or who is legally responsible for the Sickness, Injury or damages;  
  
  
  
  
■



any insurer or other indemnifier of any person or entity alleged to have
caused or who caused the Sickness, Injury or damages;

Kansas City Life Insurance Company in workers' compensation cases; or  
  
  
  
  
■



any person or entity who is or may be obligated to provide you with benefits

otherwise);  
  
  
  
  
\

Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions

As a Covered Person, you agree to the following:

  
  
  
■



the Plan has a first priority right to receive payment on any claim against a
third party before you receive payment from that third party. Further, the
Plan’s first priority right to payment is superior to any and all claims,
debts or liens asserted by any medical providers, including but not limited to
hospitals or emergency treatment facilities, that assert a right to payment
from funds you recover from a third party.  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights apply to full and partial
settlements, judgments, or other recoveries paid or payable to you or your
representative, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized.
Payments include, but are not limited to, economic, noneconomic, and punitive
damages. The Plan is not required to help you to pursue your claim for damages
or personal injuries, or pay any of your associated costs, including
attorneys' fees. No socalled "Fund Doctrine" or "Common Fund Doctrine" or
"Attorney's Fund Doctrine" shall defeat this right.  
  
  
  
  
■



The Plan has an equitable lien by agreement on any and all monies paid (or
payable to) you or for your benefit by any responsible party or other recovery
to the extent the Plan paid benefits for such Sickness or Injury;  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan may enforce its subrogation and reimbursement rights regardless of
whether you have been "made whole" (fully compensated for your injuries and
damages).  
  
  
  
  
■



you will cooperate with the Plan and its agents in a timely manner to protect
its legal and equitable rights to subrogation and reimbursement, including,
but not limited to:  
  
  
  
  
\



complying with the terms of this section;  
  
  
  
  
\



providing any relevant information requested;  
  
  
  
  
\



signing and/or delivering documents at its request;  
  
  
  
  
\



appearing at medical examinations and legal proceedings, such as depositions
or hearings; and  
  
  
  
  
\



obtaining the Plan's consent before releasing any party from liability or
payment of medical expenses.  
  
  
  
  
■



if you receive payment as part of a settlement or judgment from any third
party as a result of a Sickness or Injury, and the Plan alleges some or all of
those funds are due and owed to it, you agree to hold those settlement funds
in trust, either in a separate bank

account in your name or in your attorney's trust account. You agree that you
will serve as a trustee over those funds to the extent of the Benefits the
Plan has paid.

  
  
  
■



if the Plan incurs attorneys' fees and costs in order to collect third party
settlement funds held by you or your representative, the Plan has the right to
recover those fees and costs from you.  
  
  
  
  
■



you may not accept any settlement that does not fully reimburse the Plan,
without its written approval.  
  
  
  
  
■



you will assign to the Plan all rights of recovery against third parties to
the extent of Benefits the Plan has provided for a Sickness or Injury caused
by a third party.  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan's rights will not be reduced due to your own negligence.  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan may file suit in your name and take appropriate action to assert its
rights under this section. The Plan is not required to pay you part of any
recovery it may obtain from a third party, even if it files suit in your name.  
  
  
  
  
■



the provisions of this section apply to the parents, guardian, or other
representative of a Dependent child who incurs a Sickness or Injury caused by
a third party.  
  
  
  
  
■



in case of your wrongful death, the provisions of this section apply to your
estate, the personal representative of your estate, and your heirs.  
  
  
  
  
■



your failure to cooperate with the Plan or its agents is considered a breach
of contract. As such, the Plan has the right to terminate your Benefits, deny
future Benefits, take legal action against you, and/or set off from any future
Benefits the value of Benefits the Plan has paid relating to any Sickness or
Injury caused by any third party to the extent not recovered by the Plan due
to you or your representative not cooperating with the Plan.  
  
  
  
  
■



if a third party causes you to suffer a Sickness or Injury while you are
covered under this Plan, the provisions of this section continue to apply,
even after you are no longer a Covered Person.  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan has the authority and discretion to resolve all disputes regarding
the interpretation of the language stated herein.  
  
* * *

Subrogation – Example

Suppose you are injured in a car accident that is not your fault, and you
receive Benefits under the Plan to treat your injuries. Under subrogation, the
Plan has the right to take legal action in your name against the driver who
caused the accident and that driver's insurance carrier to recover the cost of
those Benefits.

■



How to continue coverage after it ends.  
  
* * *

Your entitlement to Benefits automatically ends on the date that coverage
ends, even if you are hospitalized or are otherwise receiving medical
treatment on that date.

When your coverage ends, Kansas City Life Insurance Company will still pay
claims for Covered Health Services that you received before your coverage
ended. However, once your coverage ends, Benefits are not provided for health
services that you receive after coverage ended, even if the underlying medical
condition occurred before your coverage ended.

Your coverage under the Plan will end on the earliest of:

  
  
  
■



the last day of the month your employment with the Company ends;  
  
  
  
  
■



the date the Plan ends;  
  
  
  
  
■



the last day of the month you stop making the required contributions;  
  
  
  
  
■



the last day of the month you are no longer eligible;  
  
  
  
  
■



the last day of the month UnitedHealthcare receives written notice from Kansas
City Life Insurance Company to end your coverage, or the date requested in the
notice, if later; or  
  
  
  
  
■



the last day of the month you retire or are pensioned under the Plan, unless
specific coverage is available for retired or pensioned persons and you are
eligible for that coverage.  
  
Coverage for your eligible Dependents will end on the earliest of:

for coverage under a QMCSO, the date the child is no longer covered under the
QMCSO.  
  
Other Events Ending Your Coverage

Your coverage may also end when any of the following happen. If your coverage
is terminated for any of the below reasons you will be provided a 30 day

Fraud, Misrepresentation or False Information  occurs when there has been
fraud or misrepresentation, or the Participant knowingly gave UnitedHealthcare
or Kansas City Life Insurance Company false material information. Examples
include false information relating to another person's eligibility or status
as a Dependent. UnitedHealthcare reserves the right to demand that you pay
back Benefits Kansas City Life Insurance Company paid to you, or paid in your
name, during the time you were incorrectly covered under the Plan.  
  
  
  
  
■



Material Violation – occurs when there was a material violation of the terms
of the Plan.  
  
  
  
  
■



Threatening Behavior – occurs when you have committed acts of physical or

Note  : Kansas City Life Insurance Company has the right to demand that you
pay back Benefits Kansas City Life Insurance Company paid to you, or paid in
your name, during the time you were incorrectly covered under the Plan.

Continuing Coverage Through COBRA

If you lose your Plan coverage, you may have the right to extend it under the
Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as defined in Section
14,  Glossary  .

Continuation coverage under COBRA is available only to group health plans that
are subject to the terms of COBRA. The Plan provides no greater COBRA rights
than what COBRA requires – nothing in this Summary Plan Description is
intended to expand your rights beyond COBRA’s requirements.

The right to COBRA coverage was created by federal law, the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA coverage can become
available to you when you would otherwise lose your group health coverage
under the Plan. It can also become available to your spouse and dependent
children who lose coverage for certain specified situations.

What is COBRA Coverage

COBRA coverage is temporary continuation of group health coverage under the
Plan when coverage would otherwise end because of a “qualifying event”. After
a qualifying event occurs and any required notice of that event is properly
provided to the Company, COBRA coverage will be offered to each person losing
group health coverage under the Plan who is a “qualified beneficiary”. You,
your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries
and would be entitled to elect COBRA if group health coverage under the Plan
is lost because of the qualifying event.

COBRA coverage is the same coverage that the Plan provides to other
participants or beneficiaries under the Plan who have not experienced a
qualifying event. Each qualified beneficiary who elects COBRA will have the
same rights under the Plan as other participants or beneficiaries covered
under the Plan’s group health coverage elected by the qualified beneficiaries,
including open enrollment and special enrollment rights. Under the Plan,
qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay the full cost for COBRA
coverage.

Coordination with Retiree Medical Plan Coverage

If you are eligible to elect retiree coverage when you retire, you will have
the onetime option of electing  either  retiree coverage or COBRA coverage.
If you elect retiree coverage, you will have no further COBRA rights,
including when your retiree coverage ends. (Note, however, that if your spouse
or dependents later lose retiree coverage on account of a qualifying event,
such as your child losing dependent status, he or she may be entitled to
continue coverage under COBRA.) If you elect COBRA coverage, you will not be
eligible to elect retiree coverage at any later date. Your election between
retiree coverage and COBRA coverage is irrevocable.

Continuation Coverage under Federal Law (COBRA)

Much of the language in this section comes from the federal law that governs
continuation coverage. You should call your Plan Administrator if you have
questions about your right to continue coverage.

In order to be eligible for continuation coverage under federal law, you must
meet the definition of a "Qualified Beneficiary". A Qualified Beneficiary is
any of the following persons who were covered under the Plan on the day before
a qualifying event:

  
  
  
■



a Participant;  
  
  
  
  
■



a Participant's enrolled Dependent, including with respect to the
Participant's children, a child born to or placed for adoption with the
Participant during a period of continuation coverage under federal law; or  
  
  
  
  
■



a Participant's former Spouse.  
  
Qualifying Events for Continuation Coverage under COBRA

The following table outlines situations in which you may elect to continue
coverage under COBRA for yourself and your Dependents, and the maximum length
of time you can receive continued coverage. These situations are considered
qualifying events.

disability, b). the date of the qualifying event, c). the date the Qualified
Beneficiary would lose coverage under the Plan, and in no event later than the

any increase in the required premium for the additional 11 months over the
original 18 months; and (iii) if the Qualified Beneficiary entitled to the 11

Beneficiaries, then those nondisabled Qualified Beneficiaries are also
entitled to the additional 11 months of continuation coverage. Notice of any
final determination that the Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled must
be provided within 30 days of such determination. Thereafter, continuation
coverage may be terminated on the first day of the month that begins more than
30 days after the date of that determination.

continuation coverage.  
  
How Your Medicare Eligibility Affects Dependent COBRA Coverage

When Plan coverage is lost because of termination of employment or reduction
in hours, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18
months before the qualifying event, COBRA coverage for qualified beneficiaries
(other than the employee) who lose coverage as a result of the qualifying
event can continue COBRA coverage until up to a maximum of 36 months after the
date of Medicare entitlement. This COBRA coverage

95 SECTION 12  WHEN COVERAGE ENDS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

period is available only if the covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare
within 18 months BEFORE termination or reduction of hours.

FMLA

If you take a leave of absence that qualified under the Family and Medical
Leave Act (FMLA) and do not return to work at the end of the leave, you (and
your spouse and dependent children, if any) will have the right to elect COBRA
if:

  
  
  
■



you were covered by group health coverage under the Plan on the day before the
FMLA leave began (or became covered by group health coverage under the Plan
during the FMLA leave); and  
  
  
  
  
■



you lose group health coverage under the Plan because the employee does not
return to work at the end of the leave.  
  
COBRA coverage will begin on the earliest of the following to occur:

  
  
  
■



when you definitively inform the Company that you are not returning at the end
of the leave; or  
  
  
  
  
■



the end of the leave, assuming you do not return to work.  
  
Newly Eligible Dependent

If you, the former employee of the Company, elect COBRA coverage and then have
a child (either by birth, adoption, or placement for adoption) during the
period of COBRA coverage, the new child is also eligible to become a qualified
beneficiary. In accordance with the terms of the Plan’s eligibility and other
requirements for group health coverage and the requirements of federal law,
these qualified beneficiaries can be added to COBRA coverage by providing the
Company (see contact information below) with notice of the new child’s birth,
adoption or placement for adoption. This notice must be provided within 31
days of birth, adoption or placement for adoption. The notice must be in
writing and must include the name of the new qualified beneficiary, date of
birth or adoption of new qualified beneficiary, and birth certificate or
adoption decree.

If you fail to notify the Company within the 31 days, you will  not  be
offered the option to elect COBRA coverage for the newly acquired child. Newly
acquired dependent (other than children born to, adopted by, or placed for
adoption with the employee) will not be considered qualified beneficiaries,
but may be added to the employee’s continuation coverage, if enrolled in a
timely fashion, subject to the Plan’s rules for adding a new dependent.

QMCSO

A child of the covered employee who is receiving benefits under the Plan
pursuant to a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) received by the
Company during the covered employee’s period of employment with the Company is
entitled to the same rights to elect COBRA as an eligible dependent child of
the covered employee.

Getting Started

  

* * *

96 SECTION 12  WHEN COVERAGE ENDS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

You will be notified by mail if you become eligible for COBRA coverage as a
result of a reduction in work hours or termination of employment. The
notification will give you instructions for electing COBRA coverage, and
advise you of the monthly cost. Your monthly cost is the full cost, including
both Participant and Employer costs, plus a 2% administrative fee or other
cost as permitted by law. The amount of your COBRA premiums may change from
time to time during your period of COBRA coverage and will most likely
increase over time. You will be notified of COBRA premium changes.

You will have up to 60 days from the date you receive notification or 60 days
from the date your coverage ends to elect COBRA coverage, whichever is later.
Your election must be postmarked within the 60day election period. If you do
not submit a completed election form within the 60day election period, you
will lose your right to COBRA.

You will then have an additional 45 days to pay the initial premium.  If you
do not make your first payment for COBRA coverage within the 45 days after the
date of your timely election, you will lose all COBRA rights under the Plan.
Thereafter, payments are due by the first day of each month to which the
payments apply (payments must be postmarked on or before the end of the 30day
grace period  ). If you fail to make a monthly payment before the end of the
grace period for that month, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage under
the Plan.

Your first payment must cover the cost of COBRA coverage from the time your
coverage under the Plan would have otherwise terminated up through the end of
the month before the month in which you make your first payment. You are
responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is correct.
You may contact (877) 7977475 to confirm the correct amount of your first
payment.

During the 60day election period, the Plan will, only in response to a
request from a provider, inform that provider of your right to elect COBRA
coverage, retroactive to the date your COBRA eligibility began.

While you are a participant in the medical Plan under COBRA, you have the
right to change your coverage election:

  
  
  
■



during Open Enrollment; and  
  
  
  
  
■



following a change in family status, as described under  Changing Your
Coverage  in Section 2  , Introduction  .  
  
Notification Requirements

If your covered Dependents lose coverage due to divorce, legal separation, or
loss of Dependent status, you or your Dependents must notify the Plan
Administrator within 60 days of the latest of:

  
  
  
■



the date of the divorce, legal separation or an enrolled Dependent's loss of
eligibility as an enrolled Dependent;  
  
  

* * *

97 SECTION 12  WHEN COVERAGE ENDS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  
  
  
  
■



the date your enrolled Dependent would lose coverage under the Plan; or  
  
  
  
  
■



the date on which you or your enrolled Dependent are informed of your
obligation to provide notice and the procedures for providing such notice.  
  
You or your Dependents must also notify the Plan Administrator when a second
qualifying event occurs that will extend continuation coverage.

If you or your Dependents fail to notify the Plan Administrator of these
events within the 60 day period, the Plan Administrator is not obligated to
provide continued coverage to the affected Qualified Beneficiary. If you are
continuing coverage under federal law, you must notify the Plan Administrator
within 31 days of the birth or adoption of a child if you want to add the
child to your coverage.

Once you have notified the Plan Administrator, you will then be notified by
mail of your election rights under COBRA.

Separate Elections

Each qualified beneficiary has an independent election right for COBRA
coverage. For example, even if the employee does not elect COBRA coverage,
other family members who are qualified beneficiaries may elect to be covered
under COBRA. Also, if there is a choice among types of coverage during an open
enrollment period, each qualified beneficiary who is eligible for COBRA
continuation coverage is entitled to make a separate election among the types
of coverage. Thus, a spouse or dependent child may elect different coverage
than the employee elects.

A covered employee or spouse can also make the COBRA election on behalf of all
qualified beneficiaries and a parent or legal guardian may make the election
on behalf of a minor child. Any qualified beneficiary for whom COBRA is not
elected within the 60day election period will lose his or her right to elect
COBRA coverage.

Coverage

If you elect COBRA continuation coverage, your coverage will generally be
identical to coverage provided to “similarly situated” employees or family
members at the time you lose coverage. However, if any changes are made to
coverage for similarly situated employees or family members, your coverage
will be modified as well. “Similarly situated” refers to a current employee or
dependent child(ren) who has not experienced a qualifying event. Qualified
beneficiaries on COBRA have the same enrollment and election change rights as
active employees.

Notification Requirements for Disability Determination

If you extend your COBRA coverage beyond 18 months because you are eligible
for disability benefits from Social Security, you must provide Human Resources
with notice of the Social Security Administration's determination within 60
days after you receive that determination, and before the end of your initial
18month continuation period.

  

* * *

98 SECTION 12  WHEN COVERAGE ENDS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

* * *

  

The notice requirements will be satisfied by providing written notice to the
Plan Administrator at the address stated in Section 15,  Important
Administrative Information: ERISA  . The contents of the notice must be such
that the Plan Administrator is able to determine the covered Employee and
qualified beneficiary(ies), the qualifying event or disability, and the date
on which the qualifying event occurred.

Trade Act of 2002

The Trade Act of 2002 amended COBRA to provide for a special second 60day
COBRA election period for certain Participants who have experienced a
termination or reduction of hours and who lose group health Plan coverage as a
result. The special second COBRA election period is available only to a very
limited group of individuals: generally, those who are receiving trade
adjustment assistance (TAA) or 'alternative trade adjustment assistance' under
a federal law called the Trade Act of 1974. These Participants are entitled to
a second opportunity to elect COBRA coverage for themselves and certain family
members (if they did not already elect COBRA coverage), but only within a
limited period of 60 days from the first day of the month when an individual
begins receiving TAA (or would be eligible to receive TAA but for the
requirement that unemployment benefits be exhausted) and only during the six
months immediately after their group health Plan coverage ended.

If a Participant qualifies or may qualify for assistance under the Trade Act
of 1974, he or she should contact the Plan Administrator for additional
information. The Participant must contact the Plan Administrator promptly
after qualifying for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 or the Participant
will lose his or her special COBRA rights. COBRA coverage elected during the
special second election period is not retroactive to the date that Plan
coverage was lost, but begins on the first day of the special second election
period.

When COBRA Ends

COBRA coverage will end before the maximum continuation period shown above if:

  
  
  
■



you or your covered Dependent first becomes covered under another group
medical Plan, after electing COBRA, as long as the other Plan doesn't limit
your coverage due to a preexisting condition; or if the other Plan does
exclude coverage due to your preexisting condition, your COBRA benefits would
end when the exclusion period ends;  
  
  
  
  
■



you or your covered Dependent first becomes entitled to, and enrolls in,
Medicare after electing COBRA;  
  
  
  
  
■



the first required premium is not paid within 45 days;  
  
  
  
  
■



any other monthly premium is not paid within 30 days of its due date;  
  
  
  
  
■



the Company no longer provides any group health plan coverage to any
employees; or  
  
  
  
  
■



coverage would otherwise terminate under the Plan as described in the
beginning of this section.  
  
  

* * *

99 SECTION 12  WHEN COVERAGE ENDS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

Note  : If you selected continuation coverage under a prior Plan which was
then replaced by coverage under this Plan, continuation coverage will end as
scheduled under the prior Plan or in accordance with the terminating events
listed in this section, whichever is earlier.

Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act

A Participant who is absent from employment for more than 30 days by reason of
service in the Uniformed Services may elect to continue Plan coverage for the
Participant and the Participant's Dependents in accordance with the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended (USERRA).

The terms "Uniformed Services" or "Military Service" mean the Armed Forces,
the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard when engaged in active duty
for training, inactive duty training, or fulltime National Guard duty, the
commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and any other category of
persons designated by the President in time of war or national emergency.

If qualified to continue coverage pursuant to the USERRA, Participants may
elect to continue coverage under the Plan by notifying the Plan Administrator
in advance, and providing payment of any required contribution for the health
coverage. This may include the amount the Plan Administrator normally pays on
a Participant's behalf. If a Participant's Military Service is for a period of
time less than 31 days, the Participant may not be required to pay more than
the regular contribution amount, if any, for continuation of health coverage.

A Participant may continue Plan coverage under USERRA for up to the lesser of:

  
  
  
■



the 24 month period beginning on the date of the Participant's absence from
work; or  
  
  
  
  
■



the day after the date on which the Participant fails to apply for, or return
to, a position of employment.  
  
Regardless of whether a Participant continues health coverage, if the
Participant returns to a position of employment, the Participant's health
coverage and that of the Participant's eligible Dependents will be reinstated
under the Plan. No exclusions or waiting period may be imposed on a
Participant or the Participant's eligible Dependents in connection with this
reinstatement, unless a Sickness or Injury is determined by the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, the
performance of military service.

You should call the Plan Administrator if you have questions about your rights
to continue health coverage under USERRA.

FMLA Leave

The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows eligible employees to
take a specific amount of unpaid leave for serious illness, the birth or
adoption of a child, to care for a spouse, child, or parent who has a serious
health condition, to care for family members wounded while on active duty in
the Armed Forces, or to deal with any qualifying exigency that arises from a
family member’s active duty in the Armed Forces. This leave is also available
for family members of veterans for up to five years after a veteran leaves
service if he or she develops a servicerelated injury or illness incurred or
aggravated while on active duty. See Human Resources for more information
about what leave is available under the FMLA.

If you take an FMLA leave, you may continue your group health coverage for you
and any covered dependents as long as you continue to pay your portion of the
cost for your benefits during the leave. If you take a paid leave of absence,
the cost of group health coverage will continue to be deducted from your pay
on a pretax basis. If you take an unpaid leave of absence that qualifies
under FMLA, you may continue your participation as long as you contribute the
active employee share of the cost of group health coverage during the leave in
a method approved and made available by Kansas City Life Insurance Company
FMLA leave policy.  You also have the option to suspend your health coverage
during the leave.

If you experience a change in status event while you are on leave, or upon
your return from leave, you may make appropriate changes to your elections.
Any coverages that are terminated during your FMLA leave will be reinstated
upon your return without any evidence of good health or newly imposed waiting
period. If you lose any group health coverage during an FMLA leave because you
did not make the required contributions, you may reenroll when you return
from your leave. Your group health coverage will start again on the first day
after you return to work and make your required contributions. If you do not
return to work at the end of your FMLA leave you may be entitled to purchase
COBRA continuation coverage.

Qualified Medical Child Support Orders (QMCSOs)

A qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) is a judgment, decree or
order, including a court approved settlement agreement, issued by a court or
appropriate state agency that requires a child to be covered for medical
benefits. Generally, a QMCSO is issued as part of a paternity, divorce, or
other child support settlement.

If the Plan receives a medical child support order for your child that
instructs the Plan to cover the child, the Plan Administrator will review it
to determine if it meets the requirements for a QMCSO. If it determines that
it does, your child will be enrolled in the Plan as your Dependent, and the
Plan will be required to pay Benefits as directed by the order.

You may obtain, without charge, a copy of the procedures governing QMCSOs from
the Plan Administrator.

Note:  A National Medical Support Notice will be recognized as a QMCSO if it
meets the requirements of a QMCSO.

Your Relationship with UnitedHealthcare and Kansas City Life Insurance Company

In order to make choices about your health care coverage and treatment, Kansas
City Life Insurance Company believes that it is important for you to
understand how UnitedHealthcare interacts with the Plan Sponsor's benefit Plan
and how it may affect you. UnitedHealthcare helps administer the Plan
Sponsor's benefit Plan in which you are enrolled. UnitedHealthcare does not
provide medical services or make treatment decisions. This means:

  
  
  
■



Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare do not decide what
care you need or will receive. You and your Physician make those decisions;  
  
  
  
  
■



UnitedHealthcare communicates to you decisions about whether the Plan will
cover or pay for the health care that you may receive (the Plan pays for
Covered Health Services, which are more fully described in this SPD); and  
  
  
  
  
■



the Plan may not pay for all treatments you or your Physician may believe are
necessary. If the Plan does not pay, you will be responsible for the cost.  
  
Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare may use individually
identifiable information about you to identify for you (and you alone)
procedures, products or services that you may find valuable. Kansas City Life
Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare will use individually identifiable
information about you as permitted or required by law, including in our
operations and in our research. Kansas City Life Insurance Company and
UnitedHealthcare will use deidentified data for commercial purposes including
research.

exclusive discretion to:

  
  
  
■



interpret Benefits under the Plan;  
  
  
  
  
■



interpret the other terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of the Plan,
including this SPD and any Riders and/or Amendments; and  
  
  
  
  
■



make factual determinations related to the Plan and its Benefits.  
  
Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare may delegate this
discretionary authority to other persons or entities that provide services in
regard to the administration of the Plan.

In certain circumstances, for purposes of overall cost savings or efficiency,
Kansas City Life Insurance Company may, in its discretion, offer Benefits for
services that would otherwise not be Covered Health Services. The fact that
Kansas City Life Insurance Company does so in any particular case shall not in
any way be deemed to require Kansas City Life Insurance Company to do so in
other similar cases.

Information and Records

Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare may use your
individually identifiable health information to administer the Plan and pay
claims, to identify procedures, products, or services that you may find
valuable, and as otherwise permitted or required by law. Kansas City Life
Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare may request additional information from
you to decide your claim for Benefits. Kansas City Life Insurance Company and
UnitedHealthcare will keep this information confidential. Kansas City Life
Insurance Company and the Claims Administrator may also use your deidentified
data for commercial purposes, including research, as permitted by law.

By accepting Benefits under the Plan, you authorize and direct any person or
institution that has provided services to you to furnish Kansas City Life
Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare with all information or copies of
records relating to the services provided to you. Kansas City Life Insurance
Company and UnitedHealthcare have the right to request this information at any
reasonable time. This applies to all Covered Persons, including Enrolled
Dependents whether or not they have signed the Participant's enrollment form.
Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare agree that such

Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare have the right to
release any and all records concerning health care services which are

its related entities may use and transfer the information gathered under the
Plan in a deidentified format for commercial purposes, including research and
analytic purposes.

For complete listings of your medical records or billing statements Kansas
City Life Insurance Company recommends that you contact your health care
provider. Providers may charge you reasonable fees to cover their costs for
providing records or completing requested forms.

If you request medical forms or records from UnitedHealthcare, they also may
charge you reasonable fees to cover costs for completing the forms or
providing the records.

In some cases, Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare will
designate other persons or entities to request records or information from or
related to you, and to release those records as necessary. Our designees have
the same rights to this information as does the Plan Administrator.

Incentives to Providers

Network providers may be provided financial incentives by UnitedHealthcare to
promote the delivery of health care in a cost efficient and effective manner.
These financial incentives are not intended to affect your access to health
care.

Examples of financial incentives for Network providers are:

  
  
  
■



bonuses for performance based on factors that may include quality, member
satisfaction, and/or costeffectiveness; or  
  
  
  
  
■



a practice called capitation which is when a group of Network providers
receives a monthly payment from UnitedHealthcare for each Covered Person who
selects a Network provider within the group to perform or coordinate certain
health services. The Network providers receive this monthly payment regardless
of whether the cost of providing or arranging to provide the Covered Person's
health care is less than or more than the payment.  
  
If you have any questions regarding financial incentives you may contact the
telephone number on your ID card. You can ask whether your Network provider is
paid by any financial incentive, including those listed above; however, the
specific terms of the contract, including rates of payment, are confidential
and cannot be disclosed. In addition, you may choose to discuss these
financial incentives with your Network provider.

Incentives to You

Sometimes you may be offered coupons or other incentives to encourage you to
participate in various wellness programs or certain disease management
programs. The decision about whether or not to participate is yours alone but
Kansas City Life Insurance Company recommends that you discuss participating
in such programs with your Physician. These incentives are not Benefits and do
not alter or affect your Benefits. You may call the number on the back of your
ID card if you have any questions.

Rebates and Other Payments

Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare may receive rebates
for certain drugs that are administered to you in a Physician's office, or at
a Hospital or Alternate Facility. This includes rebates for those drugs that
are administered to you before you meet your Annual Deductible. Kansas City
Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare do not pass these rebates on to
you, nor are they applied to your Annual Deductible or taken into account in
determining your Copays or Coinsurance.

Workers' Compensation Not Affected

Benefits provided under the Plan do not substitute for and do not affect any
requirements for coverage by workers' compensation insurance.

Future of the Plan

Although the Company expects to continue the Plan indefinitely, it reserves
the right to discontinue, alter or modify the Plan in whole or in part, at any
time and for any reason, at its sole determination.

The Company's decision to terminate or amend a Plan may be due to changes in
federal or state laws governing employee benefits, the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code or Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), or any other reason. A Plan change may transfer Plan assets and debts
to another Plan or split a Plan into two or more parts. If the Company does
change or terminate a Plan, it may decide to set up a different Plan providing
similar or different benefits.

If this Plan is terminated, Covered Persons will not have the right to any
other Benefits from the Plan, other than for those claims incurred prior to
the date of termination, or as otherwise provided under the Plan. In addition,
if the Plan is amended, Covered Persons may be subject to altered coverage and
Benefits.

The amount and form of any final benefit you receive will depend on any Plan
document or contract provisions affecting the Plan and Company decisions.
After all Benefits have been paid and other requirements of the law have been
met, certain remaining Plan assets will be turned over to the Company and
others as may be required by any applicable law.

Plan Document

This Summary Plan Description (SPD) represents an overview of your Benefits.
In the event there is a discrepancy between the SPD and the official Plan
document, the Plan document will govern. Copies of these documents, as well as
the latest summary annual reports of Plan operations and Plan descriptions as
filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Labor, are
available for your inspection during regular business hours in the office of
the Plan Administrator. You (or your personal representative) may obtain a

Unproven Services  – health services, including medications that are
determined not to be effective for treatment of the medical condition and/or
not to have a beneficial effect on health outcomes due to insufficient and
inadequate clinical evidence from wellconducted randomized controlled trials
or cohort studies in the prevailing published peerreviewed medical
literature:

  
  
  
■



Wellconducted randomized controlled trials are two or more treatments
compared to each other, with the patient not being allowed to choose which
treatment is received.  
  
  
  
  
■



Wellconducted cohort studies are studies in which patients who receive study
treatment are compared to a group of patients who receive standard therapy.
The comparison group must be nearly identical to the study treatment group.  
  
UnitedHealthcare has a process by which it compiles and reviews clinical
evidence with respect to certain health services. From time to time,
UnitedHealthcare issues medical and drug policies that describe the clinical
evidence available with respect to specific health care services. These
medical and drug policies are subject to change without prior notice. You can
view these policies at  www.myuhc.com  .

Please note:

  
  
  
■



If you have a life threatening Sickness or condition (one that is likely to
cause death within one year of the request for treatment), UnitedHealthcare
may, at its discretion, consider an otherwise Unproven Service to be a Covered
Health Service for that Sickness or condition. Prior to such a consideration,
UnitedHealthcare must first establish that there is sufficient evidence to
conclude that, albeit unproven, the service has significant potential as an
effective treatment for that Sickness or condition, and that the service would
be provided under standards equivalent to those defined by the National
Institutes of Health.  
  
  
  
  
■



UnitedHealthcare may, in their discretion, consider an otherwise Unproven
Service to be a Covered Health Service for a Covered Person with a Sickness or
Injury that is not lifethreatening. For that to occur, all of the following
conditions must be met:  
  
  
  
  
\



If the service is one that requires review by the  U.S. Food and Drug
Administration  (FDA), it must be FDAapproved.  
  
  
  
  
\



It must be performed by a Physician and in a facility with demonstrated
experience and expertise.  
  
  
  
  
\



The Covered Person must consent to the procedure acknowledging that
UnitedHealthcare does not believe that sufficient clinical evidence has been
published in peerreviewed medical literature to conclude that the service is
safe and/or effective.  
  
  
  
  
\



At least two studies must be available in published peerreviewed medical
literature that would allow UnitedHealthcare to conclude that the service is
promising but unproven.  
  
  
  
  
\



The service must be available from a Network Physician and/or a Network
facility.

The decision about whether such a service can be deemed a Covered Health
Service is solely at UnitedHealthcare’s discretion. Other apparently similar
promising but unproven services may not qualify.

Urgent Care  – treatment of an unexpected Sickness or Injury that is not life
threatening but requires outpatient medical care that cannot be postponed. An
urgent situation requires prompt medical attention to avoid complications and
unnecessary suffering, such as high fever, a skin rash, or an ear infection.

Urgent Care Center  – a facility that provides Urgent Care services, as
previously defined in this section. In general, Urgent Care Centers:

  
  
  
■



do not require an appointment;  
  
  
  
  
■



are open outside of normal business hours, so you can get medical attention
for minor illnesses that occur at night or on weekends; and  
  
  
  
  
■



provide an alternative if you need immediate medical attention, but your
Physician cannot see you right away.

Identification Card (ID Card) – Network Pharmacy

You must either show your ID card at the time you obtain your Prescription
Drug at a Network Pharmacy or you must provide the Network Pharmacy with
identifying information that can be verified by the Claims Administrator
during regular business hours.

If you don't show your ID card or provide verifiable information at a Network
Pharmacy, you will be required to pay the Usual and Customary Charge for the
Prescription Drug at the pharmacy.

Benefit Levels

Benefits are available for outpatient Prescription Drugs that are considered
Covered Health Services.

The Plan pays Benefits at different levels for tier1, tier2 and tier3
Prescription Drugs. All Prescription Drugs covered by the Plan are categorized
into these three tiers on the Prescription Drug List (PDL). The tier status of
a Prescription Drug can change periodically, generally quarterly but no more
than six times per calendar year, based on the Prescription Drug List
Management Committee's periodic tiering decisions. When that occurs, you may
pay more or less for a Prescription Drug, depending on its tier assignment.
Since the PDL may change periodically, you can visit  www.myuhc.com  or call
UnitedHealthcare at the tollfree number on your ID card for the most current
information.

Each tier is assigned a Copay, which is the amount you pay when you visit the
pharmacy or order your medications through mail order. Your Copay will also
depend on whether or not you visit the pharmacy or use the mail order service
 see the table shown at the beginning of this section for further details.
Here's how the tier system works:

  
  
  
■



Tier1 is your lowest Copay option. For the lowest outofpocket expense, you
should consider tier1 drugs if you and your Physician decide they are
appropriate for your treatment.  
  
  
  
  
■



Tier2 is your middle Copay option. Consider a tier2 drug if no tier1 drug
is available to treat your condition.  
  
  
  
  
■



Tier3 is your highest Copay option. The drugs in tier3 are usually more
costly. Sometimes there are alternatives available in tier1 or tier2.  
  
For Prescription Drugs at a retail Network Pharmacy, you are responsible for
paying the lower of:

  
  
  
■



the applicable Copay;  
  
  
  
  
■



the Network Pharmacy's Usual and Customary Charge for the Prescription Drug;
or  
  
  
  
  
■



the Prescription Drug Cost that UnitedHealthcare agreed to pay the Network
Pharmacy.  
  
For Prescription Drugs from a mail order Network Pharmacy, you are responsible
for paying the lower of:

  
  
  
■



the applicable Copay; or  
  
  

* * *

123 SECTION 15  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN

■



the Prescription Drug cost for that particular Prescription Drug.  
  
Retail

The Plan has a Network of participating retail pharmacies, which includes many
large drug store chains. You can obtain information about Network Pharmacies
by contacting UnitedHealthcare at the tollfree number on your ID card or by
logging onto  www.myuhc.com  .

To obtain your prescription from a retail pharmacy, simply present your ID
card and pay the Copay. The Plan pays Benefits for certain covered
Prescription Drugs:

  
  
  
■



as written by a Physician;  
  
  
  
  
■



up to a consecutive 31day supply, unless adjusted based on the drug
manufacturer's packaging size or based on supply limits;  
  
  
  
  
■



when a Prescription Drug is packaged or designed to deliver in a manner that
provides more than a consecutive 31day supply, the Copay that applies will
reflect the number of days dispensed; and  
  
  
  
  
■



a onecycle supply of an oral contraceptive. You may obtain up to three cycles
at one time if you pay a Copay for each cycle supplied.  
  
Note:  Pharmacy Benefits apply only if your prescription is for a Covered
Health Service, and not for Experimental or Investigational, or Unproven
Services. Otherwise, you are responsible for paying 100% of the cost.

Mail Order

The mail order service may allow you to purchase up to a 90day supply of a
covered maintenance drug through the mail. Maintenance drugs help in the
treatment of chronic illnesses, such as heart conditions, allergies, high
blood pressure, and arthritis.

To use the mail order service, all you need to do is complete a patient
profile and enclose your prescription order or refill. Your medication, plus
instructions for obtaining refills, will arrive by mail about 14 days after
your order is received. If you need a patient profile form, or if you have any
questions, you can reach UnitedHealthcare at the tollfree number on your ID
card.

The Plan pays mail order Benefits for certain covered Prescription Drugs:

  
  
  
■



as written by a Physician; and  
  
  
  
  
■



up to a consecutive 90day supply, unless adjusted based on the drug
manufacturer's packaging size or based on supply limits.  
  
You may be required to fill an initial Prescription Drug order and obtain 1 –
3 refills through a retail pharmacy prior to using a mail order Network
Pharmacy.

124 SECTION 15  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN

Note:  To maximize your benefit, ask your Physician to write your prescription
order or refill for a 90day supply, with refills when appropriate. You will
be charged a mail order Copay for any prescription order or refill if you use
the mail order service, regardless of the number of days' supply that is
written on the order or refill. Be sure your Physician writes your mail order
or refill for a 90day supply, not a 30day supply with three refills.

Benefits for Preventive Care Medications

Benefits under the Prescription Drug Plan include those for Preventive Care
Medications as defined under  Glossary – Prescription Drugs  . You may
determine whether a drug is a Preventive Care Medication through the internet
at  www.myuhc.com  or by calling UnitedHealthcare at the tollfreetelephone
number on your ID card.

Designated Pharmacy

If you require certain Prescription Drugs, UnitedHealthcare may direct you to
a Designated Pharmacy with whom it has an arrangement to provide those
Prescription Drugs.

Want to lower your outofpocket Prescription Drug costs?

Consider tier1 Prescription Drugs, if you and your Physician decide they are
appropriate.

Assigning Prescription Drugs to the PDL

UnitedHealthcare's Prescription Drug List (PDL) Management Committee makes the
final approval of Prescription Drug placement in tiers. In its evaluation of
each Prescription Drug, the PDL Management Committee takes into account a
number of factors including, but not limited to, clinical and economic
factors. Clinical factors may include:

  
  
  
■



evaluations of the place in therapy;  
  
  
  
  
■



relative safety and efficacy; and  
  
  
  
  
■



whether supply limits or notification requirements should apply.  
  
Economic factors may include:

  
  
  
■



the acquisition cost of the Prescription Drug; and  
  
  
  
  
■



available rebates and assessments on the cost effectiveness of the
Prescription Drug.  
  
Some Prescription Drugs are most cost effective for specific indications as
compared to others, therefore, a Prescription Drug may be listed on multiple
tiers according to the indication for which the Prescription Drug was
prescribed.

When considering a Prescription Drug for tier placement, the PDL Management
Committee reviews clinical and economic factors regarding Covered Persons as a
general population. Whether a particular Prescription Drug is appropriate for
an individual Covered Person is a determination that is made by the Covered
Person and the prescribing Physician.

  

* * *

125 SECTION 15  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN

The PDL Management Committee may periodically change the placement of a
Prescription Drug among the tiers. These changes will not occur more than six
times per calendar year and may occur without prior notice to you.

Prescription Drug, Prescription Drug List (PDL), and Prescription Drug List
(PDL) Management Committee are defined at the end of this section.

Prescription Drug List (PDL)

The Prescription Drug List (PDL) is a tool that helps guide you and your
Physician in choosing the medications that allow the most effective and
affordable use of your Prescription Drug benefit.

Notification Requirements

Before certain Prescription Drugs are dispensed to you, it is the
responsibility of your Physician, your pharmacist or you to notify
UnitedHealthcare. UnitedHealthcare will determine if the Prescription Drug is:

  
  
  
■



a Covered Health Service as defined by the Plan; and  
  
  
  
  
■



not Experimental or Investigational or Unproven, as defined in Section 14,
Glossary  .  
  
Network Pharmacy Notification

When Prescription Drugs are dispensed at a Network Pharmacy, the prescribing
provider, the pharmacist, or you are responsible for notifying the Claims
Administrator.

NonNetwork Pharmacy Notification

When Prescription Drugs are dispensed at a nonNetwork Pharmacy, you or your
Physician are responsible for notifying the Claims Administrator.

If UnitedHealthcare is not notified before the Prescription Drug is dispensed,
you may pay more for that Prescription Drug order or refill. You will be
required to pay for the Prescription Drug at the time of purchase. The
contracted pharmacy reimbursement rates (the Prescription Drug Cost) will not
be available to you at a nonNetwork Pharmacy. If UnitedHealthcare is not
notified before you purchase the Prescription Drug, you can request
reimbursement after you receive the Prescription Drug  see Section 9,  Claims
Procedures  , for information on how to file a claim.

When you submit a claim on this basis, you may pay more because you did not
notify the Claims Administrator before the Prescription Drug was dispensed.
The amount you are reimbursed will be based on the Prescription Drug Cost (for
Prescription Drugs from a Network Pharmacy) or the Predominant Reimbursement
Rate (for Prescription Drugs from a nonNetwork Pharmacy), less the required
Copayment and/or Coinsurance and any Deductible that applies.

  

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN

To determine if a Prescription Drug requires notification, either visit
www.myuhc.com  or call the tollfree number on your ID card. The Prescription
Drugs requiring notification are subject to UnitedHealthcare's periodic review
and modification.

Benefits may not be available for the Prescription Drug after the Claims
Administrator reviews the documentation provided and determines that the
Prescription Drug is not a Covered Health Service or it is an Experimental or
Investigational or Unproven Service.

Prescription Drug Benefit Claims

For Prescription Drug claims procedures, please refer to Section 9,  Claims
Procedures  .

Limitation on Selection of Pharmacies

If the Claims Administrator determines that you may be using Prescription
Drugs in a harmful or abusive manner, or with harmful frequency, your
selection of Network Pharmacies may be limited. If this happens, you may be
required to select a single Network Pharmacy that will provide and coordinate
all future pharmacy services. Benefits will be paid only if you use the
designated single Network Pharmacy. If you don't make a selection within 31
days of the date the Plan Administrator notifies you, the Claims Administrator
will select a single Network Pharmacy for you.

Supply Limits

Some Prescription Drugs are subject to supply limits that may restrict the
amount dispensed per prescription order or refill. To determine if a
Prescription Drug has been assigned a maximum quantity level for dispensing,
either visit  www.myuhc.com  or call the tollfree number on your ID card.
Whether or not a Prescription Drug has a supply limit is subject to
UnitedHealthcare's periodic review and modification.

Note:  Some products are subject to additional supply limits based on criteria
that the Plan Administrator and the Claims Administrator have developed,
subject to periodic review and modification. The limit may restrict the amount
dispensed per prescription order or refill and/or the amount dispensed per
month's supply.

If a Brandname Drug Becomes Available as a Generic

If a Brandname Prescription Drug becomes available as a Generic drug, the
tier placement of the Brandname Drug may change and an Ancillary Charge may
apply. As a result, your Copay may change. You will pay the Copay applicable
for the tier to which the Prescription Drug is assigned.

Prescription Drugs that are Chemically Equivalent

If two drugs are chemically equivalent (they contain the same active
ingredient) and you or your Physician choose not to substitute a lower tiered
drug for the higher tiered drug, you will pay the difference between the
higher tiered drug and the lower tiered drug, in addition to the lower tiered
drug’s Copayment. This difference in cost is called an Ancillary Charge. An
Ancillary Charge may apply when a covered Prescription Drug is dispensed at
your or

  

* * *

127 SECTION 15  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN

* * *

  

the provider’s request and there is another drug that is chemically the same
available at a lower tier.

Special Programs

Kansas City Life Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare may have certain
programs in which you may receive an enhanced or reduced benefit based on your
actions such as adherence/compliance to medication regimens. You may access
information on these programs through the Internet at  www.myuhc.com  or by
calling the number on the back of your ID card.

Rebates and Other Discounts

UnitedHealthcare and Kansas City Life Insurance Company may, at times, receive
rebates for certain drugs on the PDL. UnitedHealthcare does not pass these
rebates and other discounts on to you nor does UnitedHealthcare take them into
account when determining your Copays.

The Claims Administrator and a number of its affiliated entities, conduct
business with various pharmaceutical manufacturers separate and apart from
this Prescription Drug section. Such business may include, but is not limited
to, data collection, consulting, educational grants and research. Amounts
received from pharmaceutical manufacturers pursuant to such arrangements are
not related to this Prescription Drug section. The Claims Administrator is not
required to pass on to you, and does not pass on to you, such amounts.

Coupons, Incentives and Other Communications

UnitedHealthcare may send mailings to you or your Physician that communicate a
variety of messages, including information about Prescription Drugs. These
mailings may contain coupons or offers from pharmaceutical manufacturers that
allow you to purchase the described Prescription Drug at a discount or to
obtain it at no charge. Pharmaceutical manufacturers may pay for and/or
provide the content for these mailings. Only your Physician can determine
whether a change in your Prescription order or refill is appropriate for your
medical condition.

Glossary  Prescription Drugs

Ancillary Charge  – a charge, in addition to the Copayment, that you are
required to pay when a covered Prescription Drug is dispensed at your or the
provider’s request, when a chemically equivalent Prescription Drug is
available on a lower tier. For Prescription Drugs from Network Pharmacies, the
Ancillary Charge is calculated as the difference between the Prescription Drug
Charge or MAC list price for Network Pharmacies for the Prescription Drug on
the higher tier, and the Prescription Drug Charge or MAC List price of the
chemically equivalent Prescription Drug available on the lower tier. For
Prescription Drugs from nonNetwork Pharmacies, the Ancillary Charge is
calculated as the difference between the Predominant Reimbursement Rate or MAC
List price for nonNetwork Pharmacies for the Prescription Drug on the higher
tier, and the Predominant Reimbursement Rate or MAC List price of the
chemically equivalent Prescription Drug available on the lower tier.

Plan Administration

Kansas City Life Insurance Company is responsible for the general
administration of the Plan, and will be the fiduciary to the extent not
otherwise specified in this SPD or the Plan document. The Company has the
discretionary authority to construe and interpret the provisions of the Plan
and make factual determinations regarding all aspects of the Plan and its
benefits, including the power to determine the rights or eligibility of
employees and any other persons, and the amounts of their benefits under the
Plan, and to remedy ambiguities, inconsistencies or omissions. Such
determinations shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. A misstatement
or other mistake of fact will be corrected when it becomes known, and the
Company will make such adjustment on account of the mistake as it considers
equitable and practicable, in light of applicable law. Neither the Plan
Administrator nor the Company will be liable in any manner for any
determination made in good faith.

The Company may designate other organizations or persons to carry out specific
fiduciary responsibilities for the Company in administering the Plan
including, but not limited to, the following:

  
  
  
■



Pursuant to an administrative services or claims administration agreement, if
any, the responsibility for administering and managing the Plan, including the
processing and payment of claims under the Plan and the related recordkeeping,  
  
  
  
  
■



The responsibility to prepare, report, file and disclose any forms, documents,
and other information required to be reported and filed by law with any
governmental agency, or to be prepared and disclosed to employees or other
persons entitled to benefits under the Plan, and  
  
  
  
  
■



The responsibility to act as Claims Administrator and to review claims and
claim denials under the Plan to the extent an insurer or administrator is not
empowered with such responsibility.  
  
The Company will administer the Plan on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory
basis and shall apply uniform rules to all persons similarly situated.

Your ERISA Rights

As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and
protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be
permitted to:

  
  
  
■



receive information about Plan Benefits;  
  
  
  
  
■



examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other
specified worksites, all Plan documents – including pertinent insurance
contracts, trust agreements, collective bargaining agreements, summary annual
reports, and other documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service or the
U.S. Department of Labor, and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the
Employee Benefits Security Administration;  
  
  
  
  
■



obtain copies of all Plan documents and other Plan information, including
insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the
latest summary annual  
  
  

* * *

136 SECTION 16  ERISA

* * *

KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS TRADITIONAL PLAN

reports, and updated Summary Plan Descriptions, by writing to the Plan
Administrator. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for copies;
and

  
  
  
■



receive a summary annual report of the Plan's financial activities. The Plan
Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of
this summary annual report.  
  
You can continue health care coverage for yourself, Spouse or Dependents if
there is a loss of coverage under the Plan as a result of a qualifying event.
You or your Dependents may have to pay for such coverage. Review this Summary
Plan Description and the Plan documents to understand the rules governing your
COBRA continuation coverage rights.

You will be provided a certificate of creditable coverage in writing, free of
charge, from  UnitedHealthcare:

  
  
  
■



when you lose coverage under the Plan;  
  
  
  
  
■



when you become entitled to elect COBRA;  
  
  
  
  
■



when your COBRA coverage ends;  
  
  
  
  
■



if you request a certificate of credible coverage before losing coverage; or  
  
  
  
  
■



if you request a certificate of credible coverage up to 24 months after losing
coverage.  
  
You may request a certificate of creditable coverage by calling the tollfree
number on your ID card.

If you have creditable coverage from another group health Plan, you may
receive a reduction or elimination of exclusionary periods of coverage for
preexisting conditions under your group health Plan. Without evidence of
creditable coverage, Plan Benefits for the treatment of a preexisting
condition may be excluded for 12 months (18 months for late enrollees) after
your enrollment date in your coverage. In addition to creating rights for Plan
participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for the
operation of the Plan. The people who operate your Plan, who are called
"fiduciaries" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest
of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your
Employer or any other person may fire you or otherwise discriminate against
you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan Benefit or exercising your
rights under ERISA.

If your claim for a Plan Benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part,
you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents
relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within
certain time schedules. See Section 9,  Claims Procedures  , for details.

Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For
instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest summary annual
report from the Plan, and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file
suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan
Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you
receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent for reasons beyond
the control of the Plan Administrator.

If you have a claim for Benefits, which is denied or ignored, in whole or in
part, and you have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the
Plan, you may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you
disagree with the Plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified
status of a domestic relations order, you may file suit in federal court. If
it should happen that the Plan's fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if
you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek
assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a
federal court.

The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are
successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs
and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees;
for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.

If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan
Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your
rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the
Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee
Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your
telephone directory, or write to the Division of Technical Assistance and
Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of
Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W. Washington, DC 20210. You may also obtain
certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by
calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security
Administration at (866) 4443272.

Selecting a Contracted Provider

After registering for the program you can view ParentSteps facilities and
clinics online based on location, compare IVF cycle outcome data for each
participating provider and see the specific rates negotiated by ParentSteps
with each provider for select types of infertility treatment in order to make
an informed decision.

Visiting Your Selected Health Care Professional

Once you have selected a provider, you will be asked to choose that clinic for
a consultation. You should then call and make an appointment with that clinic
and mention you are a ParentSteps member. ParentSteps will validate your
choice and send a validation email to you and the clinic.

Obtaining a Discount

If you and your provider choose a treatment in which ParentSteps discounts
apply, the provider will enter in your proposed course of treatment.
ParentSteps will alert you, via email, that treatment has been assigned. Once
you log in to the ParentSteps website, you will see your treatment plan with a
cost breakdown for your review.

After reviewing the treatment plan and determining it is correct you can pay
for the treatment online. Once this payment has been made successfully
ParentSteps will notify your provider with a statement saying that treatments
may begin.

Speaking with a Nurse

Once you have successfully registered for the ParentSteps program you may
receive additional educational and support resources through an experienced
infertility nurse. You may even work with a single nurse throughout your
treatment if you choose.

support, please contact a ParentSteps nurse via phone (tollfree) by calling
